    "# Mass Flow Meter \\& Datalogger Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "Mass flow meters are widely used instruments in fluid mechanics and engineering applications to measure the mass or volume flow rate of a fluid. The fundamental working principle involves a **low-inertia turbine** placed in the fluid flow path. As the fluid passes through the turbine, it rotates at a speed proportional to the flow rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components and Operation\n",
    "1. **Turbine with Magnetic Ring**: The turbine has a magnetic ring attached to it, with one or more interruptions (gaps) in the magnetic field.\n",
    "2. **Hall Effect Sensor**: A sensor positioned near the turbine detects the changes in the magnetic field as the turbine rotates.\n",
    "3. **Pulse Counting**: The sensor generates a series of electrical pulses, where the frequency of the pulses corresponds to the rotational speed of the turbine.\n",
    "4. **Meter Constant (K-Factor)**: The turbine and sensor assembly has a meter constant (K-factor), defined as the number of pulses generated per unit of flow. This constant is used to convert the pulse frequency into a mass or volume flow rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is then processed by a microcontroller or data acquisition system to display the flow rate in appropriate units.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Low-inertia turbines minimize lag, allowing precise measurement even at low flow rates.\n",
    "- **Compact and Scalable**: Mass flow meters are available in a wide range of sizes and capacities, suitable for different applications.\n",
    "- **Digital Output**: The pulse-based output is easy to integrate with modern control systems and data loggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Engineering Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Mass flow meters are versatile and widely used across industries. Some common applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Water and Wastewater Treatment**\n",
    "   - Monitoring the flow of water, effluent, and chemicals in treatment plants.\n",
    "   - Ensuring compliance with regulatory discharge limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Oil and Gas Industry**\n",
    "   - Measuring fuel flow rates in pipelines.\n",
    "   - Monitoring the consumption of lubricants and other fluids in mechanical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **HVAC Systems**\n",
    "   - Ensuring accurate flow rates of chilled water, refrigerants, and steam in heating and cooling systems.\n",
    "   - Optimizing energy efficiency by monitoring flow conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Food and Beverage Industry**\n",
    "   - Measuring the flow of liquids like milk, juice, and syrup in processing plants.\n",
    "   - Monitoring the flow of cleaning agents during sterilization processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Automotive and Aerospace Engineering**\n",
    "   - Fuel consumption testing for engines and turbines.\n",
    "   - Flow monitoring in hydraulic and pneumatic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Pharmaceutical and Chemical Manufacturing**\n",
    "   - Precise dosing of chemicals in production lines.\n",
    "   - Monitoring the flow of solvents and active ingredients in formulation processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Mass flow meters offer a reliable and precise solution for measuring fluid flow rates across a broad spectrum of engineering applications. Their ability to provide near real-time digital data and integrate seamlessly with automation systems makes them indispensable in modern industrial processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Setup: Raspberry Pi Zero W as Datalogger and Controller\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use a **Raspberry Pi Zero W** as the datalogger and controller, paired with an **inexpensive turbine-type mass flow meter**. The Raspberry Pi Zero W is preconfigured as a WiFi host to simplify connectivity and data acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Access the Datalogger\n",
    "1. **Connect to the Raspberry Pi's WiFi**:\n",
    "   - Locate the SSID provided in class and connect your device to it.\n",
    "   - No internet access is required, as this connection is solely for interfacing with the Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access the Raspberry Pi**:\n",
    "   - Use an SSH client to connect to the Raspberry Pi's IP address (provided in class).\n",
    "   - Once connected via SSH, start the VNC server using the command:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     vncserver\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Open the VNC Desktop**:\n",
    "   - Use a VNC client to connect to the Raspberry Pi's desktop environment.\n",
    "   - This provides full access to the Raspberry Pi's graphical interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run the Mass Flow Meter Program**:\n",
    "   - Locate the program file (`/path/filename`, as provided in class) on the Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "   - Start the program using a terminal command:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python3 /path/filename\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - When prompted, supply:\n",
    "     - **Meter Constant (K-Factor)**: Provided with the mass flow meter.\n",
    "     - **Desired Time Interval**: The time in seconds for each reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Validation\n",
    "The program is designed with robust input validation using Python's `try-except` blocks to handle invalid or pathological entries, ensuring smooth operation and accurate data logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this setup, the Raspberry Pi Zero W enables efficient and flexible data acquisition from the turbine-type mass flow meter, offering a hands-on experience with both modern IoT technology and traditional fluid mechanics instrumentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Scripts for Flow Measurement Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Below are Python scripts provided to document the workflow and enhance the understanding of the lab. These scripts are designed for data logging, processing, and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Script 1: Datalogger Initialization\n",
    "**Purpose**:  \n",
    "This script establishes communication between the Raspberry Pi and the turbine flow meter. It allows users to input key parameters, such as:\n",
    "- **Meter Constant (K-Factor)**: Provided with the flow meter.\n",
    "- **Sampling Interval**: The time between successive measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once running, the script writes flow rate data to the console, you can use redirection to write to a file if you wish.\n",
    ":::{warning}\n",
    "The script needs modification to prompt for the meter constant and time interval.  Use Try-Except structure to reduce pathalogical inputs\n",
