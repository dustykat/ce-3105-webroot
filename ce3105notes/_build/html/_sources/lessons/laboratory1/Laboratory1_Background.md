## Background
A fluid has certain measurable properties that define its state. These properties are critical for understanding how the fluid behaves in various systems.

A system is defined by its boundaries and its surroundings. The properties of interest in this laboratory focus on material properties like density, specific gravity, and viscosity.

## Fluid Properties

### Mass Density
Density (ρ) is defined as the mass per unit volume of a material:
\[ho = rac{M}{V}\]

**Units**: SI: \(kg/m^3\), FPS: \(lbm/ft^3\)

#### Measurement Methods:
1. **Gravimetric Method**: Measure mass and volume, then compute density.
2. **Hydrometer Method**: Direct reading of density using a floating instrument.
3. **Pycnometer Method**: Precision measurement using a known volume container.

---

### Specific Weight
Specific Weight (γ) is the weight per unit volume of a fluid:
\[\gamma = rac{W}{V} = rac{m \cdot g}{V}\]

---

### Specific Gravity
Specific Gravity (SG) is the ratio of a fluid's density to the density of water at the same temperature. It is dimensionless.

---

### Viscosity
Viscosity is the fluid's resistance to deformation or flow under an applied shear force.

1. **Dynamic Viscosity (μ)**: Measured as the ratio of shear stress to the velocity gradient.
   \[	au = \mu \cdot rac{\partial u}{\partial y}\]

2. **Kinematic Viscosity (ν)**: Ratio of dynamic viscosity to density.
   \[
u = rac{\mu}{ho}\]

**Measurement Method**: Stoke’s Law (falling sphere in a fluid).

## Laboratory Objectives
1. Measure density, specific gravity, and viscosity of various fluids.
2. Develop a detailed experimental protocol for the measurements.
3. Conduct experiments in triplicate.
4. Document experiments and derive key insights.

## Deliverables
1. Approved protocol before conducting experiments.
2. A comprehensive laboratory report including:
   - Derived equations for fall velocity.
   - Tabulated values compared with reference data.
   - Statistical analysis of measurements.
   - Discussion of errors and experimental improvements.
