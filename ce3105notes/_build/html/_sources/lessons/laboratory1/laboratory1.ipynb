    "## Mass Density\n",
    "\n",
    "Mass density, or just plain density, denoted by the symbol $\\rho$, is a fundamental property of all substances, including fluids. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is defined as the mass per unit volume of a material and can be expressed as an equation in words:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Density} = \\frac{\\text{Mass of the Fluid}}{\\text{Volume occupied by the fluid}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or using Greek letters, mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho = \\frac{M}{V}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Units: $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$ (SI), $\\mathrm{lbm/ft^3}$ (FPS).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of fluids, density provides critical insight into how fluids behave under various conditions, such as flow through pipes, buoyancy, and pressure variations with depth. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the density of water at standard temperature and pressure (STP) is approximately $1000~kg/m^3$, while air has a much lower density of about $1.2~kg/m^3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring Density of Fluids\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical methods to measure the density of a liquid include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gravimetric Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "This method involves directly measuring the mass and volume of a liquid sample and using the formula $\\rho = \\frac{M}{V}$.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "- Weigh an empty container on a precision scale and record its mass.\n",
    "- Fill the container with the fluid and weigh it again to determine the mass of the fluid ($M$).\n",
    "- Measure the volume ($V$) of the fluid using a graduated cylinder or volumetric flask.\n",
    "- Calculate the density.\n",
    "        \n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "\n",
    "If $M=0.25 kg$ and $V=0.00025 m^3$, the density is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rho=\\frac{0.250~kg}{0.00025~m^3}=1000 kg/m3$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hydrometer Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "A hydrometer is a floating instrument calibrated to measure fluid density directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "- Submerge the hydrometer in the fluid.\n",
    "- Read the density from the scale where the hydrometer's surface level aligns with the fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is especially useful for liquids like alcohol, brines, and oils.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pycnometer Method**\n",
    "    \n",
    "A pycnometer is a specialized container with a known volume used for highly precise density measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "- Weigh the empty, dry pycnometer.\n",
    "- Fill it with the fluid and weigh it again to determine the mass of the fluid.\n",
    "- Calculate the density using the known volume of the pycnometer.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "The pycnometer is clearly a gravimetric technique, but eliminates the need to measure the volume, as the device itself performs this measurement directly\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Density in Fluid Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding density is critical for:\n",

    "- Buoyancy Analysis: The density difference between a fluid and a submerged object determines whether it floats or sinks.\n",
    "- Hydrostatics: Density directly influences the pressure variation in a fluid column, P=ρghP=ρgh.\n",
    "- Flow Dynamics: Density is a key parameter in determining the Reynolds number, which predicts flow behavior (laminar or turbulent).\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Temperature Matters\n",

Viscosity plays a central role in fluid mechanics as it affects flow characteristics, energy losses, and the behavior of fluids in engineering systems.\n",

    "$\\tau = \\mu \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $\\tau$: is the applied shear stress ($Pa$)\n",
    "  - $\\mu$: is the dynamic viscosity ($Pa \\cdot s$)\n",
    "  - $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u}$: is the velocity gradient perpendicular to the flow.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Stoke’s Law (Falling Sphere Method)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Principle: A small sphere is dropped into a fluid, and its terminal velocity ($u$) is recorded. Under terminal velocity conditions, the drag force equals the sum of buoyant and gravitational forces. From Stoke's law, the dynamic viscosity is calculated as:\n",

    "$\\mu=\\frac{2r^2(\\rho_s−\\rho_f)g}{9u}$\n",

    "  - $g$: Gravitational acceleration ($m/s^2$)\n",
    "  - $u$: Terminal velocity ($m/s$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup: Use a tall column of fluid, small spheres, and a stopwatch to measure the sphere’s falling time over a known distance.\n",

    "Where $K$ is a calibration constant based on the tube's geometry and fluid properties.\n",

    "- Use: Suitable for measuring a wide range of viscosities, including non-Newtonian fluids.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inclined Plane Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Principle: A known volume of liquid is released on an inclined plane, and the time it takes to travel a set distance is recorded. The viscosity is inferred from the relationship between time, fluid properties, and inclination angle.\n",
    "- Use: While less precise, this method is a feasible alternative for determining relative viscosities in a laboratory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Viscosity in Fluid Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "Viscosity influences several critical aspects of fluid behavior, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Energy Losses: Higher viscosity increases resistance to flow, leading to greater energy dissipation.\n",
    "- Laminar and Turbulent Flow: The Reynolds number, which predicts flow regimes, depends on viscosity.\n",
    "- Practical Applications: From lubrication in machinery to fluid transport in pipelines, viscosity is a key parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Temperature Matters\n",
    "Viscosity is strongly temperature-dependent. Consider how honey flows more easily when warmed compared to when it’s at room temperature or chilled. Similarly, engine oil thickens in cold weather, making it harder for car engines to start.\n",
