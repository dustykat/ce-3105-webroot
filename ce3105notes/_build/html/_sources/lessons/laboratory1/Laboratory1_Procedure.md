## Laboratory 1 - Fluid Properties

### Objectives
1. Measure the density and specific gravity of various fluids.
2. Measure the viscosity of a fluid using Stoke’s Law.

### Data Acquisition

#### **PART I - Density Measurements**
1. Measure the temperature of the fluid.
2. Weigh the beaker provided using a precision balance.
3. Fill the beaker with the assigned fluid and measure its combined mass (beaker + fluid).
4. Carefully measure or estimate the volume of the fluid in the beaker using a graduated cylinder or other volumetric equipment.
5. Repeat the measurements for each assigned fluid (three replicates per fluid).

#### **PART II - Specific Gravity**
1. Carefully place the calibrated hydrometer into the fluid.
2. Record the specific gravity value corresponding to the lower meniscus.
3. Repeat the measurement three times for each assigned fluid.

#### **PART III - Viscosity**
1. Measure the diameter of the steel ball assigned to your group.
2. Carefully release the ball into the ball guide at the top of the fluid column.
3. Note the position readings at the upper and lower level markers (e.g., rubber bands).
4. Start the stopwatch when the ball passes the first marker (upper band).
5. Stop the stopwatch when the ball passes the second marker (lower band).
6. Repeat the process for each assigned sphere (three replicates per sphere).

### Data Analysis

#### **PART I - Density**
1. Calculate the density (\( ho \)) of the fluid using:
   \[ ho = rac{m}{V} \]
   where \( m \) is the mass of the fluid and \( V \) is its volume.
2. Compute the mean and standard deviation for density measurements across replicates.
3. Calculate the mass of dissolved salts in the brackish water sample.

#### **PART II - Specific Gravity**
1. Tabulate the specific gravity measurements for each fluid.
2. Compute the mean and standard deviation of the specific gravity values.
3. Create a scatter plot of calculated density (x-axis) vs. specific gravity (y-axis) and fit a straight line. Record the slope, intercept, and coefficient of determination (\( R^2 \)).

#### **PART III - Viscosity**
1. Calculate the kinematic viscosity (\( 
u \)) using:
   \[ 
u = rac{\mu}{ho} \]
   where \( \mu \) is the dynamic viscosity, computed from Stoke’s Law.
2. Use the measured densities from PART I to calculate dynamic viscosity (\( \mu \)).
3. Compute the mean and standard deviation for kinematic and dynamic viscosity values.

### Discussion/Interpretation Questions
1. Derive the equation for fall velocity starting with the force balance on the sphere.
2. Why is temperature measurement critical when determining density and viscosity?
3. Predict how water’s density and viscosity might change with temperature.
4. Explain how salts influence the density of groundwater and their importance for civil and environmental engineering.
5. Discuss standard deviation in the context of experimental accuracy and repeatability.
6. Identify potential sources of error in the lab procedures and their implications for the results.
