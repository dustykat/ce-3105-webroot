    "## Archimedes' Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Archimedes' principle states that an object submerged in a fluid experiences an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the **displaced fluid**. For partially submerged objects, the buoyant force corresponds to the weight of the volume of the **submerged portion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fully Submerged Objects: The volume of the displaced fluid equals the object's volume.\n",
    "- Partially Submerged Objects: The buoyant force balances the object's weight, ensuring it floats without sinking or rising.\n",
    "\n",
    "Archimedes principle is useful to find the volume of irregularly shaped objects - Simply submerge them into a liquid and measure the volume displaced. Similarily it is useful for determining the density of irregularly shaped objects.  (The curated videos above have examples of these applications).\n",
    "\n",
    "A more detailed representation is \n",
    "- when a solid object is fully or partially submerged into a liquid then the upward buoyant force exerted by the liquid on the object is equal to the **weight of the liquid** displaced by the object. Mathematically, this can be stated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$B = W_f = \\rho  V_f g $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $V_f$ is the volume of the liquid displaced m3, $\\rho$ is the density of the liquid ($\\frac{$kg}{m^3}$), $g$ is the gravitational acceleration and $B$ is the buoyant force ($N$) and $W_f$ is the weight of the displaced liquid ($N$).\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--Consider a submerged object shown in the Figure below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](bouyancysketch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The weight of the object causes the body to sink into the liquid, while the upward buoyant force tries\n",
    "to push it up. If the object does not sink further (or raise) then these forces are balanced. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a submerged object, the volume of the object equals the volume of the liquid displaced. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the resultant force can be written as:\n",
    "$$B - w_o = (\\rho_{f} - \\rho_{o}) V_{o} g$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where, $B$ is the buoyant force ($N$), $w_o$ is the weight of the object ($N$), $\\rho_f$\n",
    "is the density of the liquid,$\\rho_o$ is the density of the object, $g$ is\n",
    "the gravitational acceleration and $V_o$ is the volume of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "From, Archimedes Principle, the Buoyant force (B) is equal to the weight of\n",
    "the liquid displaced. From the equation above, we can say an object will be pushed\n",
    "upward if $\\rho_f$ is greater $\\rho_o$ or sink (pushed downward) when $\\rho_f$ is smaller than $\\rho_o$.\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "It is important to remember that when an object sinks to the bottom of the\n",
    "liquid in a container, there is still a buoyant force acting on it. This buoyant\n",
    "force is still equal to the weight of the liquid that is displaced. However,\n",
    "the upward buoyant force exerted on the object is insufficient to overcome\n",
    "the downward gravitational force which causes the object to sink. In this\n",
    "situation, as the object is fully submerged, the volume of the object is equal\n",
    "to the volume of the liquid displaced. The object will feel lighter than in air\n",
    "due to buoyancy.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object is floating on a surface (neither raising or sinking) then the\n",
    "volume of the liquid displaced by the object is not equal to the volume of the\n",
    "object. It is only equal to the volume of the object that is submerged in the\n",
    "liquid. However, the upward buoyant force of the liquid exactly balances the\n",
    "weight of the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Also, from Archimedes principle, the buoyant force is\n",
    "equal to the weight of the liquid that is displaced. Mathematically,\n",
