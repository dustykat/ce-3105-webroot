    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Pumps are mechanical devices that transfer energy to fluids, enabling them to overcome elevation changes or system resistance. They are used in lift stations to raise fluid from a lower elevation and in booster stations to increase pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pumps fall into two main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Positive Displacement Pumps: These displace a fixed volume of fluid per cycle, typically providing low flow rates at high heads.\n",
    "- Variable Displacement Pumps (e.g., centrifugal pumps): The flow rate depends on the system's static head or pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pump performance is described using curves that include parameters like discharge, head, efficiency, power, and Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH). System hydraulics are represented as system curves, plotting required head versus flow rate. Pumps are selected to match these curves at the desired operating point.\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase operational flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parallel pump configurations increase flow rates with minimal impact on head.\n",
    "- Series pump configurations increase head while maintaining a similar flow rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab investigates the performance of two identical pumps operating individually, in series, and in parallel configurations.\n",

    "<!--### What is a pump?\n",

    ">- Positive Displacement Pumps (e.g. Archimedes Pumps; Piston Pumps; Progressive Cavity Pumps)\n",
    ">  - Fixed volume of fluid is displaced each cycle regardless of static head/pressure\n",
    ">  - Low flow rates and higher head than variable displacement pumps\n",
    ">-Variable Displacement Pumps (e.g. Axial Pumps; Centrifugal Pumps)\n",
    ">  - Volume of fluid is dependent on static head/pressure in system (back pressure)\n",
