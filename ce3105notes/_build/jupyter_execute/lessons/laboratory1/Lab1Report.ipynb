    "## Experimental Setup\n",
    "1. Fluids were prepared at ambient temperatures, with their densities and volumes measured.\n",
    "2. Steel balls were dropped into graduated cylinders filled with fluids, and their fall times were recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "1. **Temperature Measurement:** Record temperature of each fluid using a thermometer.\n",

    "3. **Volume Measurement:** Measure fluid volumes with graduated cylinders.\n",
    "4. **Density Calculation:** Calculate density using mass and volume.\n",
    "5. **Viscosity Tests:** Record the time for steel balls to fall through the fluids, and calculate dynamic and kinematic viscosities using recorded times and Stokes’ Law.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part I - Density Measurement\n",
    "1. Ensure the balance is level and calibrated before use.\n",

    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis scripts are listed in the appendix and were used to populate the tables above.  Two key observations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The reported densities are consistent with values in the open literature, whereas the viscosities are 100-fold too small.  This under-report could be a 100X error in the computational script in the appendix most likely attributed to a unit conversion error somewhere in the code.\n",
    "2. The standard deviations and mean values of viscosity are about the same - generally that means low reliability in the experiments  (If the standard deviation is close to the mean, it  indicates a lack of precision.).  Causes could be measurement errors, especially in time - or just as likely the spheres have not reached their terminal velocity in the cylinders.  Either way (misreading the videos, or spheres still decelerating) the high standard deviation relative to the mean values means these results are suspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Glycerine exhibited higher viscosity, evident from longer fall times of the steel balls.  Salt content influenced water properties.  The solution was close to saturation as indicated by residual solids in the storage vessel. The anticipated increased viscosity of the brine solution was not observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likely sources of error include timing inaccuracies and limited trials for some measurements. A unit conversion error in the data reduction script may explain the 100-fold low values observed for viscosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=red> As noted above in the data analysis section, these results are suspect because the standard deviation is same order of magnitude as the mean values</font> These experiments should be repeated with more attention paid to gathering the viscosity data, including using taller cylinders for the Stoke's Law application (to ensure terminal velocity is reached), and better video logging to observe the spheres traverse the known distance.\n",
    " \n",
    "Such efforts have relevance to lubrication systems, such as determining optimal oil viscosities for machinery, or selecting drag reducing agents for oil pipelines. \n",
