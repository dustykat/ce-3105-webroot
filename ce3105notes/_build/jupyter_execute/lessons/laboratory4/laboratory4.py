# 1 Objectives
#  Observe the behavior of ow with change in velocity and Reynolds
# number
#  Observe the variation of frictional loss with change in velocity
# 2 Theory
# Laminar ow occurs at low velocities when the particles of waters move in
# parallel straight lines. The ow is smooth and well-ordered. As the velocity
# increases, the movement becomes undulating and at one point it breaks into
# vortices. The ow is turbulent in this case. Reynolds number can determine
# whether the ow is laminar or turbulent. For a circular pipe, it can be ex-
# pressed as
# Re = vD
#  (1)
# or
# Re = vD
#  (where  = 
#  ) (2)
# It is nearly impossible for turbulent ow to occur at Reynolds number less
# than 2000 as the turbulence will be restrained by the viscous resistance.
# However, there is a stage when laminar ow is becoming turbulent or turbu-
# lent becoming laminar. During this time, the ow is transitional ow. For
# smooth pipes, the common rule is
#  Laminar Flow: Re < 2000
#  Transitional Flow: Re = 2000 to 4000
#  Turbulent Flow: Re > 4000
# For laminar ow, the head loss due to friction is directly proportional to the
# velocity:
# i / v
