Laboratory Procedure: Estimating Liquid Viscosity Using Stokes’ Law
Objective

To estimate the dynamic viscosity (μμ) of an unknown liquid using Stokes’ Law by observing the terminal velocity of small spheres dropped into a tall column of the liquid.
Materials

    Tall transparent column (e.g., graduated cylinder or custom tube with a minimum height of 50 cm)
    Small spheres of known radius and density (e.g., steel, glass, or plastic beads)
    Liquids for testing (labeled as A, B, C, D):
        Water
        Brine (saltwater)
        Glycerine
        Chilled corn syrup
    Calipers or micrometer (to measure sphere diameter accurately)
    Precision scale (to measure sphere mass, if density is unknown)
    Thermometer (to measure liquid temperature)
    Stopwatch (for time measurement)
    Tongs or tweezers (for handling spheres)
    Data recording sheet

Theory

Stokes' Law relates the terminal velocity (vtvt​) of a sphere moving through a viscous fluid to the fluid’s viscosity:
vt=29⋅r2(ρs−ρl)gμ
vt​=92​⋅μr2(ρs​−ρl​)g​

Where:

    vtvt​: Terminal velocity of the sphere (m/s)
    rr: Radius of the sphere (m)
    ρsρs​: Density of the sphere (kg/m³)
    ρlρl​: Density of the liquid (kg/m³)
    gg: Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s29.81m/s2)
    μμ: Dynamic viscosity of the liquid (Pa·s)

Rearranging to solve for viscosity:
μ=29⋅r2(ρs−ρl)gvt
μ=92​⋅vt​r2(ρs​−ρl​)g​
Procedure

    Preparation
        Label the liquids as A, B, C, and D.
        Fill the tall column with one of the test liquids to a height of at least 50 cm.
        Allow the liquid to settle, ensuring no bubbles or disturbances.

    Sphere Selection and Measurement
        Select small spheres of known density (ρsρs​) and measure their diameter using calipers or a micrometer. Record the radius (rr).
        Measure the mass of each sphere, if needed, to verify density.

    Liquid Temperature
        Measure and record the temperature of the liquid using a thermometer, as viscosity varies with temperature.

    Dropping the Sphere
        Gently release a sphere into the center of the liquid column to minimize wall effects and turbulence.
        Observe the sphere’s motion. Once it reaches terminal velocity (steady speed), start timing the descent over a measured vertical distance.

    Timing and Distance
        Mark the starting and ending points of the measurement zone on the column.
        Use a stopwatch to measure the time (tt) taken for the sphere to traverse the distance (dd) between the marks.
        Repeat the measurement three times for each sphere-liquid combination to ensure accuracy.

    Repeat for All Liquids
        Clean and dry the spheres between tests to prevent cross-contamination.
        Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each liquid.

    Data Recording
        Record tt, dd, rr, and liquid temperature for each trial.
        Use the known densities of the liquids (ρlρl​) and spheres (ρsρs​) for calculations.

Data Analysis

    Calculate Terminal Velocity (vtvt​):
    vt=dt
    vt​=td​

    Estimate Liquid Viscosity (μμ): Substitute vtvt​, rr, ρsρs​, and ρlρl​ into the viscosity equation.

    Compare Results: Match the calculated viscosities with reference values for water, brine, glycerine, and chilled corn syrup to identify the liquids.

Safety Notes

    Handle all liquids with care to avoid spills or contamination.
    Use tongs or tweezers to handle spheres, especially when using chilled corn syrup.
    Clean up spills immediately to prevent slips.
