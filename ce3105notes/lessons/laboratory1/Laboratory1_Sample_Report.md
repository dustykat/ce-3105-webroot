### Title
Measurement of Density, Specific Gravity, and Viscosity of Fluids

### Objective
To measure the density, specific gravity, and viscosity of three assigned fluids using gravimetric and experimental methods, and to compare the results to standard reference values.

---

### Background/Theory
1. **Density**: Defined as the mass per unit volume, calculated as:
   \[ ho = rac{m}{V} \]
   where \( m \) is mass and \( V \) is volume.
   
2. **Specific Gravity**: The ratio of a fluid's density to the density of water, a dimensionless quantity.
   
3. **Viscosity**: A measure of a fluid’s resistance to shear or flow, determined using Stoke’s Law for a falling sphere:
   \[ \mu = rac{2r^2 (ho_s - ho_f) g}{9u} \]
   where:
   - \( r \): radius of the sphere
   - \( ho_s \): density of the sphere
   - \( ho_f \): density of the fluid
   - \( g \): gravitational acceleration
   - \( u \): terminal velocity of the sphere.

### Procedure
#### **Density Measurement**
1. Measure the fluid's temperature.
2. Weigh the empty beaker.
3. Fill the beaker with the fluid and measure its combined mass.
4. Measure the fluid's volume using a graduated cylinder.

#### **Specific Gravity Measurement**
1. Submerge the hydrometer in the fluid.
2. Record the hydrometer reading at the lower meniscus level.

#### **Viscosity Measurement**
1. Measure the diameter of the steel sphere.
2. Release the sphere in the fluid column.
3. Record the time it takes to travel between two markers.
