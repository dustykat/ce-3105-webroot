    "## **Procedure**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 1: Displacement Volumes and Buoyancy**\n",
    "1. **Prepare the Setup:**\n",
    "   - Measure and record the temperature of the water.\n",
    "   - Fill the graduated cylinder with a sufficient amount of water. Record the initial volume level, $ V_{\\text{initial}} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Measure Object Data:**\n",
    "   - Weigh the first object (e.g., Rock-1) and record its mass.\n",
    "   - Gently submerge the object in the water and record the new volume level, $ V_{\\text{final}} $.\n",
    "   - Calculate the displaced volume, $ \\Delta V = V_{\\text{final}} - V_{\\text{initial}} $.\n",
    "   - Repeat the procedure three times for each object (Rock-2, Composite-1, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Repeat Measurements:**\n",
    "   - Repeat the displacement experiment for all six objects.\n",
    "   - Ensure all measurements are consistent and record the data in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 2: Hydrostatic Forces and Center of Pressure**\n",
    "1. **Prepare the Apparatus:**\n",
    "   - Measure and record the water temperature.\n",
    "   - Verify both tanks in the quadrant balance are empty. Trim the assembly to ensure the submerged plane is vertical.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Partial Submersion:**\n",
    "   - Add water into the trim tank to bring the balance to the 0 position. Add weights as needed to stabilize the apparatus.\n",
    "   - Gradually add water to the quadrant tank until the apparatus is level again. Record the water depth ($ h $) and the free surface width ($ b $).\n",
    "   - Repeat the procedure for at least three trials with varying weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Full Submersion:**\n",
    "   - Fully submerge the plane surface by incrementally increasing weights and adding water to balance the apparatus.\n",
    "   - Record $ h $, $ b $, and the applied masses for at least three trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Data Analysis**\n",
    "1. **Displacement Volumes and Buoyancy:**\n",
    "   - Calculate the buoyancy force for each object using:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     $$ F_B = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot \\Delta V \\cdot g $$\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - Compare calculated object volumes with measurements from the displacement method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hydrostatic Forces:**\n",
    "   - Calculate moments, $ M $, using the formula:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     $$ M = W \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3b}{8} \\right) \\cdot h $$\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - Plot $ M $ vs. $ h $ for fully submerged data. Fit a straight line and compute $ R^2 $.\n",
    "   - Use the slope of the line to calculate the specific weight of water and compare it to literature values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Partially Submerged Data:**\n",
    "   - Plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$ M + \\frac{\\gamma_w W R_2^2 h}{2} \\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad h^3 $$\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - Evaluate the fit using $ R^2 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Deliverables**\n",
