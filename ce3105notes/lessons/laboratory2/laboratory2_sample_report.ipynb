    "\n",
    "### **Part 1: Buoyancy**\n",
    "1. Calculated the displaced volume $ \\Delta V $ for each object.\n",
    "2. Determined buoyancy forces $ F_B $ using:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    $$ F_B = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot \\Delta V \\cdot g $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compared calculated object volumes with geometry-based volumes.\n",
    "5. Verified Archimedes’ Principle for floating and submerged objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 2: Hydrostatic Forces**\n",
    "1. Compute moments from the hydrostatic pressure force $ M $ for all trials, and solve for the unknown $\\rho g$ using Newton's method and the counter moment from the hanger weight(s):\n",

The solver below will return values of $\\rho g$ that minimize the difference between the two moments (the difference should be zero).\n",

    "The average value computed for the specific weight of water was:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho g = \\gamma_w =~9490~\\frac{N}{m^3}$$\n",
    " \n",
    "The tabulated value at $T = 20^o C$ is :\n",
    "\n",
    " $$\\gamma_w =~9790~\\frac{N}{m^3}$$\n",
    " \n",
    "This means the measured value is about 3% lower than expected. Assuming the published value is correct, there are several possible reasons for the discrepancy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weight resolution: The hanger weights are only adjustable in 5-gram increments. Since the moments involved in this experiment are fairly small, that limited resolution likely introduced some rounding error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Depth measurement: We used a machinist’s ruler to measure the water surface height. The smallest increment on the ruler is 0.5 mm, but due to the thickness of the meniscus (about 2 mm), there was some guesswork involved in deciding where the actual waterline was.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Leveling: The quadrant had to be leveled manually, using a carpenter’s level and visual judgment. This introduces some subjectivity, especially when resetting between trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unit conversions and numerical precision: Because we converted all values to SI units (kilograms and meters), the numbers involved became quite small. There’s a chance that rounding or limited precision in our calculator or spreadsheet affected the final outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, a 3% underestimation seems reasonable given the experimental setup. Interestingly, the larger errors seemed to occur in the deeper trials, where one expected better accuracy. This might indicate one was less careful with setup or readings on those runs — or it could be due to larger torques magnifying small measurement errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Discussion**\n",
    "1. **Archimedes’ Principle**: Confirmed that buoyant forces matched theoretical predictions for displaced water volumes. Floating objects adhered closely to calculated masses.\n",
    "2. **Hydrostatic Forces**: Experimental results for center of pressure and moments were consistent with theoretical expectations. Minor deviations were attributed to setup precision and measurement errors.\n",
    "3. **Potential Improvements**: Better calibration of the quadrant balance and more trials could enhance result accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusions**\n",
    "This experiment validated Archimedes’ Principle and hydrostatic force theory using hands-on experimentation. The buoyancy and hydrostatic thrust analyses provided foundational insights into fluid statics, bridging theory and practice.\n",
