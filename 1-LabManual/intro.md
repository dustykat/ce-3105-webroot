# CE 3105 Mechanics of Fluids Laboratory 

## Catalog Entry

3105—Mechanics of Fluids Laboratory (1:0:1). Prerequisite: CE 3305. Experimental studies of fluid behavior.

##  Course Description
CE3105 is the laboratory course in fluids and flow phenomena and is closely linked to the lecture course. It is intended to draw to student's attention the behavior of real fluids and to expose students to experimental methods. The class will also improve technical writing skills and prepare students for the fluid mechanics section of the FE Exam. This course emphasizes collaboration through group work, and as such, a portion of the course grade will be based upon peer assessment.

Attendance and team participation is <strong> mandatory </strong>.

## Course Purpose 

:::{admonition} Why a Laboratory Experience?

A laboratory experience in engineering education provides students with hands-on opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge, develop practical skills, and foster critical thinking and problem-solving abilities essential for professional and academic success.  

Engineering relies on models to represent how the physical world behaves under various conditions. These models may be derived from physical laws (e.g., conservation of mass or energy), empirical observations, or simplifications of complex phenomena.

The **purpose** of this fluids laboratory course is not simply to repeat known formulas or perform routine measurements—it is to **test, calibrate, and validate models of fluid behavior** through structured experimentation.
