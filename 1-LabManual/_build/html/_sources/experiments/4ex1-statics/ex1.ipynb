    "\n",
    "By the end of this session, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain the scientific method in historical and engineering contexts\n",
    "- Distinguish between physical laws, empirical models, and measured data\n",

    "Theory Review – We begin by identifying the governing physical principles and equations that define the theoretical model (e.g., Bernoulli’s equation, momentum balance, or head loss formulas).\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Prediction – Using known parameters and appropriate assumptions, we calculate what the model predicts should occur under the given experimental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement and Observation – We conduct the experiment carefully, collecting data through direct measurement of key variables such as flow rate, pressure, or velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison and Error Analysis – We analyze how well the measured values align with the predicted results, using plots and error metrics such as percent error or RMS error to quantify agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation and Evaluation – Finally, we reflect on the model’s performance. Where results diverge from theory, we consider the influence of experimental error, unmodeled effects, or invalid assumptions, and discuss whether the model should be accepted, rejected, or refined.\n",

    "### A Brief History\n",
    "\n",
    "[Wikipedia: History of the Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_scientific_method) presents a good discourse on the history of the \"method;\" notable parts of that history include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Francis Bacon (1620s)**: Proposed structured observation and inductive reasoning.  The Baconian method is the investigative method developed by Francis Bacon, one of the founders of modern science, and thus a first formulation of a modern scientific method. The method was put forward in Bacon's book Novum Organum (1620), or 'New Method', to replace the old methods put forward in Aristotle's Organon. It influenced the early modern rejection of medieval Aristotelianism. He explicitly addressed causality in his writings on the subject.\n",
    "- **Galileo Galilei**: Used mathematical models to describe physical phenomena, and designed experiments to test them. Galileo Galilei played a pivotal role in shaping the modern scientific method by emphasizing experimentation, observation, and mathematical analysis. He developed a method that involved intuition, demonstration, and experimental verification to test hypotheses and build upon existing knowledge. Galileo's work, particularly in physics and astronomy, demonstrated the power of combining observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning to understand the natural world\n",
    "- **Isaac Newton**: Developed universal laws that combined observation, theory, and prediction. Isaac Newton's scientific method was a refined approach to scientific inquiry that emphasized observation, experimentation, and the use of mathematical reasoning to develop and test theories. He used a combination of theoretical reasoning and empirical observation to draw inferences and develop his groundbreaking theories of motion and gravitation.\n",

    "### Engineering Adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "The engineering design process is a structured approach to solving problems, building upon the principles of the scientific method but with a focus on practical application and creating tangible solutions. The primary tool is a model which relates the excitation-response behavior of the world.  Design can rely upon the model once it is demonstrated to be reliable and accurate - the point of experimentation is usually to test the model (for applicability, reliability, and accuracy). \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Scientific-method-directed experiments**, where theory guides the inquiry, predictions are made, and results are critically evaluated to test a hypothesis or validate a model.\n",
    "- **\"Cook-and-look\" experiments**, where a procedure is followed step-by-step with little theoretical framing or expectation, often leading to passive observation rather than active discovery.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scientific-Method-Directed Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics:\n",
    "- Begins with a hypothesis or model derived from theory\n",
    "- Predictions are made in advance\n",
    "- Experiments are **designed** to test, calibrate, or refute the model\n",
    "- Measurements are compared to expectations with quantitative rigor\n",
    "- Discrepancies lead to refinement of models and deeper understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notable Successes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Galileo’s inclined plane experiments (1600s)**  \n",
    "  Tested mathematical relationships between acceleration, time, and distance, providing early evidence for the laws of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cavendish’s measurement of the gravitational constant (1797)**  \n",
    "  Designed to quantify Newton’s law of universal gravitation—not merely observe attraction.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Michelson–Morley experiment (1887)**  \n",
    "  Failed to detect the \"aether wind\" predicted by classical physics. Though it produced a “null result,” it motivated a shift in understanding that led to Einstein’s theory of relativity.\n",

    "- Emphasis is on procedure compliance, not interpretation\n",
    "- Often ends with, “The results didn’t match, but we followed the steps.”\n",

    "### Occasional Successes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alexander Fleming’s discovery of penicillin (1928)**  \n",
    "  Accidental contamination of a petri dish revealed antibacterial effects—not predicted by theory, but recognized through observation.\n",

    "- **Discovery of cosmic microwave background (Penzias and Wilson, 1965)**  \n",
    "  Researchers were troubleshooting antenna noise and stumbled onto the remnant of the Big Bang—without initially understanding the implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples show that \"cook-and-look\" can occasionally lead to breakthroughs, but only if the observer is prepared to recognize the unexpected and reframe the context.\n",

    "### Common Failures\n",
    "\n",
    "- Countless teaching, research, and industrial laboratories where results are recorded without interpretation.\n",

    "This experiment is based on the **Bernoulli equation**, which states that for an incompressible, steady, inviscid flow along a streamline, the total mechanical energy is conserved. The pressure drop between the wide and narrow sections of a Venturi meter can be related to the flow velocity.\n",
