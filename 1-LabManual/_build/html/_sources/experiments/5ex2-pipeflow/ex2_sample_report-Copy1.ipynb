    "- Include sample calculations for discharge and mass flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Discussion\n",
    "- Analyze the accuracy and reliability of each device.\n",
    "- Compare experimental results with theoretical predictions.\n",
    "- Does the mass flow meter have the correct meter constant (a value that relates turbine rotations to flow rate); if not suggest a better constant.\n",
