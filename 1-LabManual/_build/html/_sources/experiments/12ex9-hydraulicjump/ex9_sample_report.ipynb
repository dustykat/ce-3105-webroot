    "## Laboratory Apparatus\n",
    "\n",
    "The apparatus is a recirculating water flume (photo below), width 1 ft, comprising a supply tank (in the flume base) a head tank, two pumps, rectangular channel with side rails, depth gauges, total head tubes, bed tappings and downstream control gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](flumephoto.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment is comprised of: \n",
    "1. measuring depth over a low height weir and determine discharge in the flume\n",
    "2. creating a hydraulic jump, stabilizing it (my varying slope and slucie gate opening), then measuring the alternate and sequent depths and comparing these to calculated values based on the discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Zero the Depth Gauge**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Position the depth gauge directly over the weir.  \n",
    "2. Move the transit (the vertical sliding carriage) to approximately the middle of its motion range.  \n",
    "3. Lower the point gauge until the tip just touches the top of the weir.  \n",
    "4. Tighten the adjustment screw gently to lock the pointer in place.  \n",
    "5. Move the gauge slightly upstream and verify that it can still reach the channel bottom.  \n",
    "6. The gauge is now zeroed — all subsequent readings will be relative to the weir crest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Establish and Measure the Hydraulic Jump**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure the flume slope is set to approximately 4% (as pre-set by the instructor or TA).  \n",
    "   This slope may appear steep, but it produces a well-defined jump within the short flume.  \n",
    "2. Start both recirculating pumps. The valves should already be fully open; verify with the instructor.  \n",
    "3. Raise the sluice gate to about 50 mm above the channel bottom to establish flow.  \n",
    "   - Monitor the head tank — if it fills too quickly or the level rises above the rail, raise the gate slightly higher.  \n",
    "   - The target condition is steady flow with the head tank level just below the rail height.  \n",
    "4. Adjust the sluice gate opening and/or channel slope until a visible hydraulic jump forms roughly midway between the head tank and the weir.  \n",
    "   - The exact position is not critical, but it should be far enough downstream from the manometers to allow easy use of the depth gauge.  \n",
    "5. Allow the flow to reach steady conditions.  \n",
    "6. Measure the upstream (alternate) depth approximately halfway between the headgate and the jump.  \n",
    "7. Measure the downstream (sequent) depth at a location where the surface appears relatively stable—typically about halfway between the jump and the weir.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Likely Sources and Direction of Error:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Measurement location interpretation. The water surface near the hydraulic jump is irregular, and selecting the exact position for depth measurement can slightly alter results. A reading taken slightly upstream or downstream of the intended location could yield a few millimeters of difference.\n",
    "- Standing wave effects. Surface oscillations can raise or lower the apparent water level depending on when the reading is taken. Measuring near the crest of a standing wave likely caused the observed depth to be slightly higher than the predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Minimize Error**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take several quick readings at the same station and compute the average depth.\n",
    "- Measure in a quieter region of the flow where surface fluctuations are smaller.\n",
    "- Ensure the point gauge or digital probe is vertical and aligned with the same longitudinal station each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "A difference of only 4 mm (≈2%) demonstrates excellent agreement between theoretical prediction and experimental observation.\n",
    "Given the turbulent nature of the hydraulic jump and the difficulty of identifying a stable surface level, this result confirms that both the measurement technique and theoretical model are performing well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predicted vs. Observed Length\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicted jump length: 1156 mm\n",
    "Observed jump length: 1200 mm\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute error (Observed − Predicted): $E=1200−1156=44 mm$\n",
    "\n",
    "Percent error (relative to predicted): $\\%E_{pred} = \\frac{44}{1156} \\approx 3.8 \\%$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**\n",
    "The predicted and observed jump lengths show excellent agreement, with less than 4% difference.\n",
    "Considering that the observed value was derived from photo-based stationing rather than direct flume measurement, this level of correspondence suggests that the empirical relation used (Hager, 1992) provides a reasonable first-order estimate for jump extent under laboratory conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the length of a hydraulic jump is not sharply defined. The flow transitions gradually from the highly turbulent roller region to a quasi-uniform downstream condition. As a result, determining where the jump “ends” often depends on the observer’s judgment or the chosen definition criterion—for example, where surface oscillations damp out or where mean velocity becomes approximately uniform.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future experiments, the jump length should be measured systematically from the toe of the jump (identified visually or from depth data) to the end of the roller region where the surface becomes relatively smooth. Repeated measurements under steady conditions, ideally supported by video analysis or depth profiles, would allow for a more objective comparison with theoretical predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the small discrepancy observed here reinforces the validity of the empirical formula and highlights that, in small-scale flumes, measurement uncertainty often rivals or exceeds modeling error. In field-scale structures, additional factors such as bed roughness, tailwater control, and three-dimensional effects would further influence jump length and energy dissipation.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Key Takeaway(s)\n",

    "## Summary and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment demonstrated the fundamental principles governing open-channel hydraulics and the formation of a hydraulic jump. Using a controlled flume setup, students determined discharge from a narrow-crested weir, created a stable hydraulic jump, and compared measured sequent depths and jump lengths with theoretical and empirical predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computed discharge of approximately **0.019 m³/s** established the flow conditions used to predict alternate and sequent depths. The predicted sequent depth (186 mm) and the observed value (190 mm) agreed within **2 percent**, indicating excellent consistency between theory and experiment. Similarly, the predicted and observed jump lengths (1156 mm and 1200 mm, respectively) differed by less than **4 percent**, reinforcing that empirical relationships such as those presented by Hager (1992) provide realistic estimates of hydraulic jump behavior in laboratory channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy and power loss calculations confirmed that a hydraulic jump is an effective energy dissipator. Even at small laboratory scale, a significant portion of the upstream specific energy was converted into turbulence and heat within the jump region. The measured head loss (≈ 0.32 m) and corresponding power dissipation emphasize the jump’s engineering role in protecting downstream structures from erosion and excessive velocities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrepancies between predicted and observed quantities were primarily attributable to measurement uncertainty—especially in identifying the exact start and end of the jump—and to the unsteady nature of the roller. Improved measurement techniques, such as averaging multiple readings or analyzing video stills, would reduce these uncertainties in future trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the results validate theoretical models of hydraulic jumps and demonstrate how laboratory-scale experiments can effectively reproduce and analyze complex hydraulic phenomena. The exercise also illustrates key experimental principles—careful observation, repeatability, and comparison of theoretical and empirical methods—that are essential in professional engineering practice.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Key Takeaway(s)\n",
    "- The hydraulic jump provides a clear example of **momentum conservation** and **energy dissipation** in open-channel flow.  \n",
    "- Agreement between measured and predicted values demonstrates that empirical design formulas can reliably estimate real-world behavior.  \n",
    "- Accurate experimental results depend on **clear measurement definitions**, **repeatable procedures**, and **critical comparison** of data with theory.  \n",

    "When reviewing student submissions, look for the following elements in the **Summary and Conclusions** section:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conceptual understanding:**  \n",
    "  The student should clearly connect observed phenomena to the theory of hydraulic jumps, specifically referencing conservation of momentum and energy dissipation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantitative synthesis:**  \n",
    "  Expect numerical results (predicted vs. observed depths and jump lengths) to be restated and interpreted. Minor discrepancies should be explained logically, emphasizing sources of experimental uncertainty rather than computation errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reflection on measurement and error:**  \n",
    "  Strong reports will acknowledge how instrument limitations, surface turbulence, or observation bias affect data accuracy. Look for specific strategies proposed to improve precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Engineering insight:**  \n",
    "  The student should relate laboratory findings to real-world design applications — for instance, stilling basins, spillways, or energy dissipation structures — even briefly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Writing quality:**  \n",
    "  The tone should be factual, objective, and concise. Excessive narrative or unsupported speculation should be discouraged. Correct units, significant figures, and technical terminology are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high-quality conclusion integrates both numerical and conceptual reasoning, demonstrating that the student can *interpret* as well as *compute* the behavior of open-channel flows.\n",
