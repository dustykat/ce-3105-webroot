The standard deviations and mean values of viscosity are about the same - generally that means low reliability in the experiments  (If the standard deviation is close to the mean, it  indicates a lack of precision.).  Causes could be measurement errors, especially in time - or just as likely the spheres have not reached their terminal velocity in the cylinders.  Either way (misreading the videos, or spheres still decelerating) the high standard deviation relative to the mean values means these results are suspect."

    "## **Discussion**\n",
    "1. **Archimedes’ Principle**: Confirmed that buoyant forces matched theoretical predictions for displaced water volumes. Floating objects adhered closely to calculated masses.\n",
    "2. **Hydrostatic Forces**: Experimental results for center of pressure and moments were consistent with theoretical expectations. Minor deviations were attributed to setup precision and measurement errors.\n",
    "3. **Potential Improvements**: Better calibration of the quadrant balance and more trials could enhance result accuracy.\n",

    "## **Conclusions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fluid Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "Glycerine exhibited higher viscosity, evident from longer fall times of the steel balls.  Salt content influenced water properties.  The solution was close to saturation as indicated by residual solids in the storage vessel. The anticipated increased viscosity of the brine solution was not observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likely sources of error include timing inaccuracies and limited trials for some measurements. A unit conversion error in the data reduction script may explain the 100-fold low values observed for viscosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=red> As noted above in the data analysis section, these results are suspect because the standard deviation is same order of magnitude as the mean values</font> These experiments should be repeated with more attention paid to gathering the viscosity data, including using taller cylinders for the Stoke's Law application (to ensure terminal velocity is reached), and better video logging to observe the spheres traverse the known distance.\n",
    " \n",
    "Such efforts have relevance to lubrication systems, such as determining optimal oil viscosities for machinery, or selecting drag reducing agents for oil pipelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Bouyancy and Hydrostatic Force Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment validated Archimedes’ Principle and hydrostatic force theory using hands-on experimentation. The buoyancy and hydrostatic thrust analyses provided foundational insights into fluid statics, bridging theory and practice.  Newton's method was employed to balance moments in the quadrant balance and solve for values of unspecified density.  The resulting values having small (unreported) variance over a wide range of depths shows both the precision conferred by the quadrant balance (as opposed to gravimetric measurements) and verifies the hydrostatic pressure assumption.\n",
