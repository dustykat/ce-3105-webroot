    "The purpose of Laboratory 81 is to compare a computed water surface profile to an experimental profile and confirm or refute the ability of computational hydraulics to predict behavior of real systems.  \n",

    "Using a computer and provided algorithms, create a computed water surface profile for the conditions of the laboratory flume.  \n",

    "The computer program will need the channel cross-section geometry (rectangular), channel discharge ($Q$ - unknown, but measurable using principles of sharp-crested weir), the channel slope, the channel resistance term (Manning's $n$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental measurements include the depth of flow over the weir crest (assumed critical depth - this is the only reliable way to estimate discharge), the channel slope, the depth of flow at stations $-30,-60, ... ,300 cm$ marked on the channel walls."

    "8. Measure the height of the water surface above the channel bottom at the 12 stations marked on the flume.\n",

    "2. The distance to floor (DTF) is measured from the top rail to the floor at each station location - assuming the epoxy coating is uniform and the floor was placed using self-leveling concrete these values are used to determine an average slope for the apparatus, which is used to validate or refute the channel slope device on the flume.  The slopes are computed using adjacent stations\n",

    "$$ \\bar S_o = 0.01695 ~~;~~ \\sigma = 0.821 $$ The variation is moderate — the standard deviation is nearly 50% of the mean. This result suggests either inherent variability in the floor (not level, hence unsuitable as a datum) or of the flume (the top rail is not parallel to the flume bottom), and/or instrument noise (tape measure is hard to read), or setup differences between trials.  Nevertheless, the value is reasonably close to the slope indicator value of 0.015.  Or more precisely, the slope indicator value of 0.015 is within the +/- 1 standard deviation range from the distance to floor measurements."

    "## Summary and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison between measured and simulated water surface profiles shows close agreement under the experimental conditions. The simulation, based on a fixed spatial step method and calibrated inputs, captures the overall shape and gradient of the observed profile with high fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several sources of experimental error may contribute to the small discrepancies observed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Channel bed irregularities:** The laboratory floor is not perfectly level and is therefore unsuitable as a true datum, introducing bias into depth readings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flume construction tolerances:** The top rail of the flume is not precisely parallel to the bottom, affecting alignment and potentially skewing visual depth references.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instrument noise and operator variability:** The primary measurement tool for determining channel slope (a tape measure) is difficult to read accurately across multiple stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Datum and stationing uncertainty:** The digital depth-to-water (DTW) sensor may not maintain a consistent zero point, and the physical stationing of measurements along the flume is imprecise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weir crest elevation:** Uncertainty in the weir crest measurement directly affects flow estimates and introduces variability in the control section depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplified hydraulics:** The use of a standard sharp-crested weir formula, while appropriate for first-order calculations, may not capture all the subtleties of the laboratory flow conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these, errors associated with channel slope estimation are particularly impactful, as slope directly influences computed friction losses and governs the profile shape. Likewise, the weir-based discharge estimate significantly affects velocity and energy gradient calculations. Incorporating an alternate or supplementary method for measuring discharge (e.g., timed volumetric collection or electromagnetic flow sensor) would enhance the reliability of input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these uncertainties, the model prediction error remains small—with a root mean squared error (RMSE) under 4 mm. This level of discrepancy is measurable with high-resolution laboratory tools but would likely fall within the uncertainty band of standard field instruments (e.g., staff gages, velocity meters, wading rods).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to recognize that these computational methods are typically applied to **riverine-scale** systems, not centimeter-scale laboratory models. That they produce meaningful and accurate results at all at such a small small scale is both surprising and reassuring. It speaks to the robustness of the governing hydraulic principles and underscores the utility of such models in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary conclusion is that computational hydraulic methods provide accurate predictions of water surface profiles, even under imperfect laboratory conditions. With thoughtful calibration and awareness of key sensitivities—particularly slope and discharge—such models are valuable tools for both design and analysis in hydraulic engineering."
