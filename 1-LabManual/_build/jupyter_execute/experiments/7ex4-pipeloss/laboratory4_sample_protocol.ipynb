    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observe how flow behavior changes with velocity and Reynolds number.\n",
    "- Measure the variation in frictional loss with changing velocity.\n",
    "- Develop continued experience with automated data acquisition by using the flowmeter calibrated in a prior laboratory.\n",
    "- Employ electronic pressure transducers using a similar end-user programmed automated data logger.\n",
    "    Develop an experimental protocol (step-by-step instructions) to measure flow (two methods), pressure drop (three methods), and head loss (computed), and Reynolds' number (computed).\n",
    "    Upon approval of the protocol, conduct a set of experiments in triplicate to measure flow and pressure drop.\n",
    "    Document the experiment(s) in a laboratory report and address the following in the report:\n",
    "        Compare flow rate measurements using stopwatch and bucket method to the flowmeter (Raspberry Pi).\n",
    "        Compare pressure drop using manometers, handheld pressure instruments, and the automated datalogger system.\n",
    "        Assess the accuracy and repeatability of the measurements using triplicate data.\n",
    "        Evaluate the benefit of automated methods in terms of mean and variance.\n",

    "## Data Acquisition\n",
    "1. **Flow Rate Measurement**\n",
    "   \n",
    "Method 1: Stopwatch and Bucket Method\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Setup: Collect water in a known volume container (e.g., bucket).\n",
    "  - Flow Measurement: Start the stopwatch when water begins flowing and stop it when the bucket reaches a predefined volume.\n",
    "  - Calculation: Compute the flow rate Q=VolumeTimeQ=TimeVolume​.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method 2: Flowmeter (Raspberry Pi)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Setup: Use the previously calibrated flowmeter (from a prior lab). Connect the flowmeter to the pipe and ensure it is properly interfaced with the Raspberry Pi data logger.\n",
    "  - Flow Measurement: Record the flow rate directly from the Raspberry Pi interface, ensuring that the correct meter constant is used.\n",
    "  - Verification: Compare the flow rate obtained from the flowmeter to the stopwatch and bucket method (see comparisons in report).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pressure Drop Measurement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Method 1: Manometer Method\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Setup: Attach the manometer to appropriate ports before and after the test pipe section.\n",
    "  - Pressure Measurement: Record the head difference ($\\Delta h$) using the manometer, convert to $\\Delta P$ using fluid properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method 2: Handheld Pressure Meter\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Setup: Connect the handheld pressure meter to the test pipe.\n",
    "  - Pressure Measurement: Record pressure along the pipe using the handheld instrument (direct readout, choose useful units).\n",
    "\n",
    "Method 3: Automated Data Logger and Pressure Transducer\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Setup: Connect the pressure transducers to the data logger system.\n",
    "  - Calibration: Use the voltage-to-pressure conversion constant obtained during the lab to convert the transducer's output voltage to pressure.  (This step can be done as a post-processing step)\n",
    "  - Pressure Measurement: Record pressure differences ($\\Delta P$) using the automated data logger system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow Measurements:\n",
    "- Compare the flow rates from the stopwatch/bucket method and the flowmeter.\n",
    "- Discuss whether low flow rates are measurable using the flowmeter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pressure Drop Measurements:\n",
    "- Compare the pressure drop results from the manometers, handheld pressure instrument, and the automated datalogger.\n",
    "- Use the manometer and handheld instruments as \"ground-truth\" to determine the multiplier needed for the automated datalogger’s transducer readings.\n",
    "- Check for linearity of the transducers based on your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reynolds Number:\n",
    "- Compute the Reynolds number for each set of measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Friction Factor:\n",
    "- Calculate the friction factor using the Darcy-Weisbach equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Analysis:\n",
    "- Compute mean and standard deviation for triplicate data sets.\n",
    "- Analyze the data to assess accuracy and repeatability."
