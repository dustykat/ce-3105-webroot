    "## 1. Title & Objective\n",
    "**Title:** _Lab X — Short Descriptive Title_  \n",
    "**Objective(s):** List 1–3 measurable objectives (verbs like *estimate, validate, compare, calibrate*).\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Example_: Calibrate the Pitot tube by comparing Pitot-derived velocities to wind tunnel reference speeds and produce a calibration curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Background / Theory\n",
    "Briefly summarize principles and key equations used. Define all variables and units. Cite sources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "_Example equations:_  \n",
    "$ V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\,\\Delta P}{\\rho}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Materials & Equipment\n",
    "- Instrument(s) and model numbers (e.g., differential pressure transducer, thermometer)\n",
    "- Calibration resources (certificates/standards)\n",
    "- Software (e.g., Python version, libraries)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Experimental Setup\n",
    "- Diagram or labeled photo of the setup (Fig. 1).  \n",
    "- Instrument placement/alignment and sign conventions.  \n",
    "- **Environmental conditions:** Temperature, pressure, etc., and how ρ was obtained.  \n",
    "- **Calibration/zeroing:** What was calibrated and how.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Procedure (What You Did)\n",
    "Provide a concise, **numbered** procedure actually followed (note deviations from the handout). Include replicates and timing/sampling rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Raw Data (excerpt)\n",
    "Provide a representative table; attach complete raw data in Appendix A (CSV or spreadsheet). Ensure **units** and **significant figures**.\n",
    "| Trial | Variable(s) | Reading(s) | Unit |\n",
    "|---:|---|---:|:--|\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Derived Quantities\n",
    "Show how raw data were transformed (e.g., averages of replicates, density from P/T, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Analysis & Uncertainty\n",
    "- **Model/Method:** Regressions, curve fits, or physics-based models used.  \n",
    "- **Assumptions & checks:** e.g., laminar regime, steady state, terminal velocity reached.  \n",
    "- **Uncertainty:** Show either replicate statistics (mean ± SD/SE) or error propagation; include residuals for fits.  \n",
    "- **Sample calculation:** One fully worked example with units.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Results (Tables & Figures)\n",
    "- Plot(s) with labeled axes, units, and captions (Fig. 2, 3, …).  \n",
    "- Tables with clear headings and units (Table 1, 2, …).  \n",
    "- If using color scales, include a legend or colorbar with units.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Reproducibility:** Figures/tables must be generated by your attached code/notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Interpretation & Engineering Judgment\n",
    "- Address the objective(s): What do the results *mean*?  \n",
    "- Compare to references/standards; note discrepancies and likely causes.  \n",
    "- Decision/recommendation tied to criteria (e.g., pass/fail, calibration factor).  \n",
    "- Limitations and how they impact conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Conclusions\n",
    "Bullet list of the 2–4 takeaways that answer the objective(s). Include recommended next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## References\n",
    "Cite texts, lab handouts, and data sources. Use a consistent style (e.g., APA/ASCE).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Appendices\n",
    "- **Appendix A — Raw data files** (CSV/spreadsheet).  \n",
    "- **Appendix B — Code/Notebook** used for analysis and figures.  \n",
    "- **Appendix C — Calibration certificates** or reference tables.  "
