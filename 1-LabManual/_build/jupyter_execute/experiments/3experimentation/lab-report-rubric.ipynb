    "The instructor uses a Language Learning Model (OnPrem.LLM; Modular, privacy-first, local document & prompt handling) to generate feedback and provide an initial score for your work. To ensure accurate evaluation and maximize your score:\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Naming Convention\n",
    "Follow the explicit file name convention provided by the instructor (e.g., LastName_FirstName_AssignmentName.pdf). This ensures your work is identifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Format\n",
    "Submit your work as a PDF file. If your assignment involves computational scripts or code, include them as clearly formatted appendices in the same PDF or submit a zipped folder containing both the PDF and the scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure Your Document \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the report format provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Consistent Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a standard font (e.g., Times New Roman, 12pt) and 1.5x line spacing.\n",
    "- Use headings for major sections (e.g., \"Problem 1,\" \"Solution\").\n",
    "- Label and reference all figures, tables, and equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "- If applicable, embed short code snippets directly into the document and ensure they are legible.\n",
    "- For longer scripts, attach them in an appendix or as separate files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculations and Units\n",
    "\n",
    "- Show all steps in your calculations (representative calculations are preferable -  I assume you will use a script or spreadsheet for repetitive calculations).\n",
    "- Use consistent units throughout and verify that units are included in all results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphs and Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clearly label all axes and include titles. [**Graphics Conventions (link)**](http://54.243.252.9/engr-1330-webroot/engr1330jb/_build/html/lessons/lesson14/lesson14.html)\n",
    "- Add legends if multiple datasets are plotted.\n",
    "- Ensure diagrams are annotated and relevant to your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### References\n",
    "\n",
    "Cite all external materials used (e.g., textbooks, research papers, or online resources)."
