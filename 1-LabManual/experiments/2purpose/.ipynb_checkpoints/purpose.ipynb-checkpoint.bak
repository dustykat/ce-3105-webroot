    "# 1. Course Purpose\n",
    "Engineering relies on models to represent how the physical world behaves under various conditions. These models may be derived from physical laws (e.g., conservation of mass or energy), empirical observations, or simplifications of complex phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of this fluids laboratory course is not simply to repeat known formulas or perform routine measurements—it is to **test, calibrate, and validate models of fluid behavior** through structured experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Why a Laboratory Experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "A laboratory experience in engineering education provides students with hands-on opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge, develop practical skills, and foster critical thinking and problem-solving abilities essential for professional and academic success.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will follow a **consistent** experimental process rooted in the scientific method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Develop/Review the governing theory.**  Identify the underlying model for the system under investigation—whether it's Bernoulli's equation, the Darcy-Weisbach equation, or a momentum balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Predict behavior based on the model.**  Before touching any equipment, calculate what should happen based on the inputs and assumptions. This includes identifying dependent variables, known parameters, and expected relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Measure the system’s behavior experimentally.**  Use lab equipment to collect data. Take care to understand how instruments work, and estimate uncertainty where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compare model predictions with measurements.**  Plot your results, compute error metrics (such as percent error, root-mean-square error, or residuals), and assess whether the model agrees with reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluate and reflect.**  Consider whether deviations are due to limitations in the model, instrumentation error, procedural issues, or real-world complexity. Can the model be recalibrated? Was a core assumption invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Each lab will begin with a **Mini-Model Statement** in the pre-lab, and will conclude with a structured comparison between theory and observation. Your task is not simply to “verify” formulas—but to **explore how models perform in real-world conditions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reflective, model-driven approach is central to the work of engineers.  "
