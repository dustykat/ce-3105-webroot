# 1. Title & Objective
**Title:** _Lab X — Short Descriptive Title_  
**Objective(s):** List 1–3 measurable objectives (verbs like *estimate, validate, compare, calibrate*).

> _Example_: Calibrate the Pitot tube by comparing Pitot-derived velocities to wind tunnel reference speeds and produce a calibration curve.

# 2. Background / Theory
Briefly summarize principles and key equations used. Define all variables and units. Cite sources.  
_Example equations:_  
\[ V = \sqrt{\frac{2\,\Delta P}{\rho}} \]

# 3. Materials & Equipment
- Instrument(s) and model numbers (e.g., differential pressure transducer, thermometer)
- Calibration resources (certificates/standards)
- Software (e.g., Python version, libraries)

# 4. Experimental Setup
- Diagram or labeled photo of the setup (Fig. 1).  
- Instrument placement/alignment and sign conventions.  
- **Environmental conditions:** Temperature, pressure, etc., and how ρ was obtained.  
- **Calibration/zeroing:** What was calibrated and how.

# 5. Procedure (What You Did)
Provide a concise, **numbered** procedure actually followed (note deviations from the handout). Include replicates and timing/sampling rates.

# 6. Data
## 6.1 Raw Data (excerpt)
Provide a representative table; attach complete raw data in Appendix A (CSV or spreadsheet). Ensure **units** and **significant figures**.
| Trial | Variable(s) | Reading(s) | Unit |
|---:|---|---:|:--|

## 6.2 Derived Quantities
Show how raw data were transformed (e.g., averages of replicates, density from P/T, etc.).

# 7. Results (Tables & Figures)
- Plot(s) with labeled axes, units, and captions (Fig. 2, 3, …).  
- Tables with clear headings and units (Table 1, 2, …).  
- If using color scales, include a legend or colorbar with units.

> **Reproducibility:** Figures/tables must be generated by your attached code/notebook.

# 8. Analysis & Uncertainty
- **Model/Method:** Regressions, curve fits, or physics-based models used.  
- **Assumptions & checks:** e.g., laminar regime, steady state, terminal velocity reached.  
- **Uncertainty:** Show either replicate statistics (mean ± SD/SE) or error propagation; include residuals for fits.  
- **Sample calculation:** One fully worked example with units.

# 9. Interpretation & Engineering Judgment
- Address the objective(s): What do the results *mean*?  
- Compare to references/standards; note discrepancies and likely causes.  
- Decision/recommendation tied to criteria (e.g., pass/fail, calibration factor).  
- Limitations and how they impact conclusions.

# 10. Conclusions
Bullet list of the 2–4 takeaways that answer the objective(s). Include recommended next steps.

# 11. References
Cite texts, lab handouts, and data sources. Use a consistent style (e.g., APA/ASCE).

# 12. Appendices
- **Appendix A — Raw data files** (CSV/spreadsheet).  
- **Appendix B — Code/Notebook** used for analysis and figures.  
- **Appendix C — Calibration certificates** or reference tables.

## Grading Rubric Mapping (attach this page)
Use the common rubric (0–3 per criterion). Fill in self-assessment before submission.

| Criterion (ABET 6) | 3 — Exemplary | 2 — Proficient | 1 — Developing | 0 — Beginning | Score (0–3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **C1. Design & Planning** *(develop)* | Clear objective; variables; calibration; justified sampling; acceptance criteria | Objective/variables clear; reasonable sampling | Vague variables/sampling; weak rationale | No coherent plan |   |
| **C2. Execution & Data Quality** *(conduct)* | Correct setup; calibration recorded; adequate resolution; complete metadata; safe | Minor issues | Major issues; questionable data | Unsafe/incorrect; unusable |   |
| **C3. Analysis & Uncertainty** *(analyze)* | Appropriate methods; uncertainty quantified; checks/residuals; units | Core correct; limited uncertainty | Basic calcs; minimal uncertainty | Incorrect/absent |   |
| **C4. Interpretation & Judgment** *(interpret + judgment)* | Weigh alternatives; links to principles; limits; balanced recommendation | Reasonable interpretation | Descriptive only; weak recommendation | Misinterpretation; no decision |   |
| **C5. Conclusions & Communication** *(draw conclusions)* | Answers objective; evidence-based; clear visuals; units; next steps | Mostly supported; minor issues | Weak tie to evidence; unclear visuals | No conclusion |   |

**Weights (default):** Pre-Lab Plan {C1:40, C3:20, C4:20, C5:20}; In-Lab {C2:70, C1:10, C5:20}; Post-Lab Memo {C3:35, C4:35, C5:20, C1:10}; Practical Exam {C1:20, C3:30, C4:40, C5:10}.

**ABET(6) index (0–3):** average of weighted rubric scores across your graded artifacts.
