## Post-Lab Reflection Rubric

Include a structured reflection as the final section of your lab report. Address each of the following categories. This reflection is worth **15 points** and should demonstrate your ability to connect theory with observation.

---

### 1. Agreement with the Model (5 points)

- Clearly describe whether your measurements aligned with the model's predictions.
- Use graphs, tables, or error metrics (e.g., % error, RMSE) to support your conclusion.

> *Example: "The measured head loss was within 8% of the predicted value for all trials, suggesting good agreement with the Darcy-Weisbach model."*

---

### 2. Explanation of Discrepancies (5 points)

- If results deviated from the model, identify possible reasons:
  - Instrument error
  - Violation of assumptions
  - Model oversimplification
- Distinguish between **random** and **systematic** error where appropriate.

> *Example: "The persistent underestimation of force may be due to unaccounted friction in the pulley system, violating the ideal assumption of lossless transfer."*

---

### 3. Implications and Next Steps (5 points)

- Reflect on the experiment’s value in validating, challenging, or refining the model.
- Suggest follow-up measurements, improved procedures, or potential calibrations.

### Reflection Format Tips

- Use short paragraphs.
- Refer to specific results or figures in your report.

# Example 1: Flow Measurement with a Venturi

## 🔬 Part I — Mini-Model Statement (Pre-Lab)

### 1. Governing Model or Principle

This experiment is based on the **Bernoulli equation**, which states that for an incompressible, steady, inviscid flow along a streamline, the total mechanical energy is conserved. The pressure drop between the wide and narrow sections of a Venturi meter can be related to the flow velocity.

---

### 2. Model Equation(s)

$\Delta p = \frac{1}{2} \rho \left( V_2^2 - V_1^2 \right) $

Where:  
- $\Delta p$ = pressure difference between upstream and throat  
- $\rho$ = fluid density  
- $V_1, V_2$ = velocities at inlet and throat (related via continuity)

From continuity: $Q = A_1 V_1 = A_2 V_2$

---

### 3. Assumptions

- Steady flow
- Incompressible fluid (water)
- No energy loss due to friction or turbulence
- Accurate pressure measurements via manometer

---

### 4. Prediction of Behavior

We expect the pressure at the throat to be lower than at the inlet due to increased velocity. Using measured pressure drop and known cross-sectional areas, we can calculate discharge $Q$ and compare it to direct volumetric measurements.

---

### 5. Evaluation Criteria

We will compare the discharge calculated from the Bernoulli-based model to the flow rate measured by time-to-fill a graduated tank. Agreement within ±5% will be considered acceptable.

---

## Part II — Post-Lab Reflection

### 1. Agreement with the Model (5 pts)

The model-based flow rate was within 4.2% of the directly measured volumetric flow rate for all trials. A comparison plot (Figure 3) shows a strong correlation (R² = 0.993) between predicted and measured values.

---

### 2. Explanation of Discrepancies (5 pts)

Minor discrepancies likely arose from:
- Inexact manometer readings due to parallax
- Slight turbulence or energy loss not accounted for in the model
- Assumption of ideal flow conditions may not be fully valid in the experimental apparatus

---

### 3. Implications and Next Steps (5 pts)

This experiment confirms that the Bernoulli-based model provides a valid estimate of flow rate in a Venturi meter under controlled conditions. Future experiments could investigate how accuracy degrades with increasing turbulence or cavitation, or apply a discharge coefficient $ C_d$ to improve model fit.

# 🧪 Pre/Post-Lab Worksheet: Model-Based Experimentation

## 🔬 Part I — Mini-Model Statement (Pre-Lab)

### 1. Governing Model or Principle

This experiment tests the empirical model for **head loss due to local disturbances** in pipe systems (elbows, valves, contractions). The model is based on energy loss per unit weight using the minor loss coefficient $ K$.

---

### 2. Model Equation(s)

$ h_L = K \cdot \frac{V^2}{2g} $

Where:  
- $ h_L$ = head loss across fitting  
- $ K$ = loss coefficient (dimensionless, provided in literature)  
- $ V$ = velocity through fitting  
- $ g$ = gravitational acceleration

---

### 3. Assumptions

- Steady, incompressible flow
- Fully developed velocity profile
- Fittings are ideal representations (sharp angles, no roughness)
- Flow velocity is uniform and measured accurately

---

### 4. Prediction of Behavior

Using literature $ K$ values and measured velocities, we will predict $ h_L$ and compare it to observed pressure drops measured with manometers. Agreement within ±10% is expected.

---

### 5. Evaluation Criteria

We will calculate the theoretical $ h_L$ and compare it to measured values. Discrepancies will be assessed using percent error and qualitative examination of flow regimes (e.g., cavitation, swirl).

---

## 📊 Part II — Post-Lab Reflection

### 1. Agreement with the Model (5 pts)

Results varied significantly depending on the fitting. For a standard elbow, predicted and measured losses were within 7%, but for a sudden contraction, the measured loss was nearly 40% higher than predicted. The straight gate valve also showed large scatter.

---

### 2. Explanation of Discrepancies (5 pts)

Discrepancies are likely due to:
- Uncertainty in exact geometry and roughness of fittings vs. textbook assumptions
- Unsteady flow and local turbulence not accounted for by static $ K$ values
- Measurement error from manometers in low-head-loss scenarios
- Flow separation or secondary flows in the contraction that violate assumed velocity profiles

---

### 3. Implications and Next Steps (5 pts)

This experiment demonstrates that empirical $ K$ values may not generalize well without calibration. Real-world systems likely require field measurement or correction factors. Future work should include:
- Repetition with digital pressure sensors
- Calibration of system-specific $ K$ values using best-fit curves
- CFD modeling of complex flow structures in contractions
