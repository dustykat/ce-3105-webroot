    "\n",
    "The objective of this experiment is to investigate minor losses in pipe fittings, including bends, sudden expansions, and sudden contractions. Specifically, the experiment aims to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Measure and compare pressure drops across different fittings to determine their respective loss coefficients (KK).\n",
    "- Evaluate the relationship between pressure losses and flow velocity through various fittings.\n",
    "- Develop hands-on experience with data acquisition techniques, including manual flow rate measurements and the use of a Raspberry Pi-based flowmeter.\n",
    "- Explore how geometric factors, such as the ratio of radius of curvature to pipe diameter (R/DR/D) and area changes (AuAu​ and AdAd​), affect loss coefficients.\n",
    "- Validate experimental findings by comparing measured loss coefficients to standard tabulated values reported in the literature.\n",
    "- Encourage critical thinking by requiring:\n",
    "  - Justifcation the omission of one fitting pair if using a limited number of pressure transducers.\n",
    "  - Analyze the effects of flow regime and measurement uncertainties on experimental results."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipe networks have numerous fittings: mitre bends, elbow bends,\n",
    "large radius bends, sudden expansions and sudden contractions. There are losses due to these fittings which are known as fitting or minor losses which cause noticable pressure drops. Pressure loss across a fitting is the difference between the\n",
    "pressure at the upstream and downstream of that fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expansions and Contractions\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sudden expansion, the flow splits when it is entering the bigger diameter pipe from the smaller diameter pipe. Head is lost due to the diffusion\n",
    "and eddies in the corners. In sudden contraction, flow area is contracted\n",
    "which is known as vena contracta because of the jet formation. Head loss is\n",
    "due to vortices and eddies. Figure 1 illustrates loss at a pipe fitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](fittingloss.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the fitting above, the total head loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta H = \\Delta h + \\frac{V_u^2}{2g} - \\frac{V_d^2}{2g} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss coefficient K is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ K = \\frac{\\Delta H~2g}{V_d^2} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ K = \\frac{\\Delta H~2g}{V_u^2} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the velocity associated with the smaller diameter part of the fitting is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, the mitre and elbow have constant pipe diameters. Therefore, $V_u$ and $V_d$ are the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the sudden enlargement, the upstream velocity is used to express the velocity head. \n",
    "For the sudden contraction, the downstream velocity characterizes the velocity head.\n",

    "\n",
    "When liquid is flowing through a $90^o$ bend, depending on the ratio of radius of\n",
    "curvature to diameter of the pipe ($\\frac{R}{D}$), amount of loss differs. Smaller loss is associated with easier flow path and lower the minor loss coefficient, K\n",
    "value is. Following table summarizes the typical K values for different bends\n",
