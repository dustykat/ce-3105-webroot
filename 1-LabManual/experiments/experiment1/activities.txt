## Part 2: Reinforcement Activities

### Activity 1: Matching Models to Measurements

Students are given:
- 3 theoretical models:
  - Flow through an orifice
  - Pipe friction loss
  - Jet impact momentum

- 3 sets of plotted or tabulated measurements

**Task:** Match each dataset to a model and identify likely causes of mismatch.

### Activity 2 (Optional): Quick Error Propagation Exercise

**Given:**
- Model: $Q = C_d A \sqrt{2gh} $
- Variables with uncertainties:
  - $h = 0.75 \pm 0.01 \ \text{m}$
  - $A = 0.0025 \pm 0.0001 \ \text{m}^2$
  - $ C_d = 0.62 \pm 0.02$

**Task:** Compute $Q$ and its uncertainty via propagation, compare with observed spread in measurements.
