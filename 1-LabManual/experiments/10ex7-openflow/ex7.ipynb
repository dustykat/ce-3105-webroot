    "## Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP)\n",
    "An Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, or Acoustic Doppler Profiler, is often referred to with the acronym ADCP. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](adcp-picture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists use the instrument to measure how fast water is moving across an entire water column. An ADCP (uplooking) anchored to the seafloor can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](side-looking-adcp.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The instrument can also be mounted horizontally on seawalls or bridge pilings in rivers and canals to measure the current profile from shore to shore, and to the bottoms of ships to take constant current measurements as the boats move. In very deep areas, they can be lowered on a cable from the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The ADCP measures water currents with sound, using a principle of sound waves called the Doppler effect. A sound wave has a higher frequency, or pitch, when it moves to you than when it moves away. You hear the Doppler effect in action when a car speeds past with a characteristic building of sound that fades when the car passes.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ![](adcp-works.png)\n",
    "> \n",
    ">The ADCP works by transmitting \"pings\" of sound at a constant frequency into the water. (The pings are so highly pitched that humans and even dolphins can't hear them.) As the sound waves travel, they ricochet off particles suspended in the moving water, and reflect back to the instrument. Due to the Doppler effect, sound waves bounced back from a particle moving away from the profiler have a slightly lowered frequency when they return. Particles moving toward the instrument send back higher frequency waves. The difference in frequency between the waves the profiler sends out and the waves it receives is called the Doppler shift. The instrument uses this shift to calculate how fast the particle and the water around it are moving.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Sound waves that hit particles far from the profiler take longer to come back than waves that strike close by. By measuring the time it takes for the waves to bounce back and the Doppler shift, the profiler can measure current speed at many different depths with each series of pings.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) provide direct measurements of flow velocity across a cross-section, in contrast to traditional stage-based methods, where water surface elevation (stage) is recorded continuously and discharge is inferred using a pre-established stage–discharge rating curve. Both approaches are widely used in streamflow monitoring. While stage data remain essential—at minimum—to define cross-sectional geometry and support rating curve development, continuous velocity profiling is less commonly implemented due to cost and deployment complexity. However, advances in sensor technology and data telemetry are rapidly increasing the feasibility of high-frequency, velocity-based discharge monitoring at both permanent and temporary sites.\n",

    "Single-point velocity measurement in an open channel can be done using a Doppler flow meter that measures particle velocity at a specific point, or by using the \"six-tenths method\" with a flow meter where a single reading is taken at 60% of the water depth. For large channels, taking multiple measurements at different depths is more accurate for calculating the overall flow rate, but the six-tenths method is a common way to estimate the average velocity at a single vertical location. \n",
