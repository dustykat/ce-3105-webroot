    "\n",
    "Open-channel flow is an essential topic in hydraulics because it governs how water moves in rivers, canals, storm drains, and many other natural and engineered systems.  In this experiment, we will investigate a hydraulic jump — a rapid transition between high-velocity, shallow flow (supercritical) and low-velocity, deeper flow (subcritical).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a recirculating flume equipped with depth gauges, a digital distance gauge, and a low weir, you will measure discharge, determine upstream and downstream depths, and compare your results with theoretical relationships for alternate and sequent depths.  \n",

    "## Background and Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open-Channel Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "An open channel is a flow system with a free surface exposed to the atmosphere and primarily driven by gravity.  \n",
    "While gravity provides the driving force, open-channel behavior is also governed by momentum — the interplay between flow velocity, cross-section, and boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples include:\n",
    "- Natural channels: rivers, streams, brooks, creeks, and similar surface flows.  \n",
    "- Engineered channels: ditches, canals, aqueducts, and storm or sanitary sewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of open-channel hydraulics include:\n",
    "- Culvert, bridge, and spillway design  \n",
    "- Floodway analysis and flood prediction  \n",
    "- Sediment and contaminant transport  \n",
    "- Coastal and storm-surge modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Manning’s equation** is often used to estimate steady uniform flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "Q = \\frac{K_n}{n} A R^{2/3} S^{1/2}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where  \n",
    "$K_n$ = unit conversion factor (1.0 for SI, 1.49 for English),  \n",
    "$n$ = Manning’s roughness coefficient,  \n",
    "$A$ = flow area,  \n",
    "$R = A/P_w$ = hydraulic radius, and  \n",
    "$S$ = energy slope.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steady Rapidly Varied Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum describes how mass in motion resists change. In open-channel hydraulics, momentum analysis is especially useful when the energy equation is invalid — such as during abrupt transitions like hydraulic jumps.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key advantage of the momentum approach is that it depends only on external forces and momentum fluxes, not on the detailed internal turbulence of the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hydraulic Jump\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hydraulic jump** occurs when supercritical flow (fast and shallow) transitions abruptly to subcritical flow (slow and deep) over a short distance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](hydjump-sketch.png) ![](hyd_jump_real.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This transition dissipates energy and creates intense turbulence, which is useful in design of energy dissipation, chemical mixing, or erosion control facilities.  Hydraulic jumps are often intentionally formed in **armored channel sections** or **stilling basins** to protect downstream structures from erosion.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](controlvolume2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe the jump, we apply the **momentum equation** across a short control volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\sum F_x = \\rho Q (V_2 - V_1)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The pressure forces are hydrostatic, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "F_p = \\rho g \\bar{h} A\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting and simplifying gives the **momentum function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "(h_1 A_1) + \\frac{Q^2}{g A_1} = (h_2 A_2) + \\frac{Q^2}{g A_2}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This relation states that momentum is balanced across the jump:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "M_1 = M_2\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The two depths that satisfy this condition — $y_1$ (upstream) and $y_2$ (downstream) — are known as the **alternate** and **sequent** depths, respectively.  \n",
    "These depths are unique for a given discharge and channel geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](momentumfunctions.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow in the jump region is highly turbulent, and frictional losses within the short control volume are typically negligible compared to the overall change in momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Although open-channel flow is often described as “gravity driven,” it’s more accurate to say that open flows are **momentum dominated** — gravity provides the potential energy, but inertia and boundary conditions determine the flow pattern.  \n",
    "Open flow can even move briefly uphill if momentum is high enough, though not for long!\n",

    "The general discharge relationship is:\n",

    "Q = C_d \\, L \\, \\sqrt{2g} \\, h^{3/2}\n",

    "\n",

    "1. Measure the **head $h$** upstream of the weir crest, away from the influence of drawdown (usually 3 × $h$ upstream).  \n",
    "2. Record multiple heads at steady discharges.  \n",

    "### Flow Depth Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow depth measurements are made using a **digital distance gauge** mounted on a movable rail above the flume.  \n",
    "If the battery is depleted, the gauge can still be used as a manual point gauge — simply read depths from a standard ruler aligned with the device’s scale at different settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The digital gauge reports the **distance from the top of the rail to the pointer** ($h_D$), which in this setup represents the **distance to the water surface**.  \n",
    "The total channel depth is $h_b = 44 \\, \\text{mm}$.  \n",
    "Therefore, the **flow depth** is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "h_{\\text{flow}} = h_b - h_D\n",
    "$\n",

    "$\n",
    "h_{\\text{flow}} = h_D + P\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P$ is the height of the weir above the channel bottom.  \n",
    "This second method is particularly useful when the water depth varies significantly during the experiment.\n",

    "### Suggested Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Zeroing the Depth Gauge**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Position the depth gauge directly over the **weir**.  \n",
    "2. Move the **transit** (the vertical sliding carriage) to approximately the middle of its motion range.  \n",
    "3. Lower the **point gauge** until the tip just touches the **top of the weir**.  \n",
    "4. Tighten the adjustment screw gently to lock the pointer in place.  \n",
    "5. Move the gauge slightly upstream and verify that it can still reach the **channel bottom**.  \n",
    "6. The gauge is now zeroed — all subsequent readings will be relative to the weir crest.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Forming and Measuring the Hydraulic Jump**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure the **flume slope** is set to approximately **4%** (as pre-set by the instructor or TA).  \n",
    "   This slope may appear steep, but it produces a well-defined jump within the short flume.  \n",
    "2. Start both **recirculating pumps**. The valves should already be fully open; verify with the instructor.  \n",
    "3. Raise the **sluice gate** to about **50 mm above the channel bottom** to establish flow.  \n",
    "   - Monitor the **head tank** — if it fills too quickly or the level rises above the rail, raise the gate slightly higher.  \n",
    "   - The target condition is steady flow with the head tank level just below the rail height.  \n",
    "4. Adjust the **sluice gate opening** and/or **channel slope** until a visible **hydraulic jump** forms roughly midway between the head tank and the weir.  \n",
    "   - The exact position is not critical, but it should be far enough downstream from the manometers to allow easy use of the depth gauge.  \n",
    "5. Allow the flow to reach **steady conditions**.  \n",
    "6. Measure the **upstream (alternate) depth** approximately halfway between the headgate and the jump.  \n",
    "7. Measure the **downstream (sequent) depth** at a location where the surface appears relatively stable—typically about halfway between the jump and the weir.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "The flume is too short for the surface oscillations to fully dissipate.  \n",
    "Select a downstream measurement point that appears stable, but **no closer than 2–3 weir heights ($P$)** from the weir crest.\n",
