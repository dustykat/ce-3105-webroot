    "Graphics Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear and accurate graphics are essential in engineering communication. In professional practice, figures are not decoration—they are part of the analytical record. A poorly labeled graph or ambiguous diagram can lead to misinterpretation of data, incorrect decisions, or regulatory delays. The conventions below mirror standards used in consulting reports, design memoranda, and technical documentation. Follow them exactly to ensure your results can be understood, checked, and used by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Axes and Units\n",
    "\n",
    "Every axis must include both a variable name and units (e.g., Velocity, m/s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Units must follow SI conventions unless otherwise stated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use consistent scaling—avoid distortions that exaggerate trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Figure Titles and Captions\n",
    "\n",
    "Every figure requires a figure number and descriptive title.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Figure 3. Force–Momentum Relationship for the Flat Plate Vane\n",
    "\n",
    "Captions should explain:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is being shown\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it is significant\n",
    "\n",
    "How to interpret key features\n",
    "\n",
    "Which equation(s) the plot supports or tests\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Readability Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimum font size: 10–11 pt for axis labels, tick labels, and legends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line thickness ≥ 1.0 pt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use color sparingly; ensure contrast is readable when printed in grayscale.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Legends and Multiple Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Include legends whenever more than one dataset is shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure symbols, colors, or line-styles are distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not manipulate or remove points unless justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers must be discussed, not simply deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trendlines must use a defensible model (e.g., linear regression for linear theory).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Referencing Figures in Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Every figure must be referenced at least once in the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "“As shown in Figure 3, the flat plate exhibits a nearly linear relationship between momentum flux and force.”\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Diagram Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Schematic diagrams should show:\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement locations\n",
    "\n",
    "Boundary conditions (if applicable)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key dimensions labeled\n",
    "\n",
    "Use straight lines, clean arrows, and uniform fonts.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. LLM-Friendly Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Enclose figure captions in standard formats so the scoring engine can detect them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid pasted screenshots of tables—use real text-based tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure numerical data underlying your graph comes from machine-readable cells or scripts.\n",

    "\n",
    "Graphics Standards for CE 3105 Reports\n",
    "\n",
    "In professional hydraulics and fluid mechanics work, figures and diagrams frequently drive design decisions, safety evaluations, and regulatory approvals. Poorly constructed graphics create ambiguity, slow down reviews, and undermine engineering credibility. To reflect industry expectations, all figures in CE 3105 must adhere to the following standards:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Technical Accuracy\n",

    "\n",
    "Use consistent font and color choices across all figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain readability when printed in grayscale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep diagrams simple and functional—avoid unnecessary graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Reproducibility & Transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "Underlying data used for plots must be present in the Results or Appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data transformations must be described in the text or caption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code used to produce plots must be included in the Appendix.\n",

    "External images require citation and must not substitute for required measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plagiarism in figures (including copied schematics) is treated the same as text plagiarism.\n",
    "\n",
    "These standards are aligned with expectations you will encounter in design offices, consulting engineering reports, hydrologic/hydraulic modeling documentation, and formal submissions to state or federal agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 4. Short Version for Individual Lab Templates\n",
