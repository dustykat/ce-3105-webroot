Inside the cap is a hall detector (a coil) that converts the rotating magnetic field into a digital pulse that the microprocessor can count. These scale in size to very large devices but the general principle of operation is the same.  The figure below shows a small (20L/minute) flowmeter.\n",

    "# External Mass Flow Meter \\& Datalogger Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "Mass flow meters are widely used instruments in fluid mechanics and engineering applications to measure the mass or volume flow rate of a fluid. The fundamental working principle involves a **low-inertia turbine** placed in the fluid flow path. As the fluid passes through the turbine, it rotates at a speed proportional to the flow rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components and Operation\n",
    "1. **Turbine with Magnetic Ring**: The turbine has a magnetic ring attached to it, with one or more interruptions (gaps) in the magnetic field.\n",
    "2. **Hall Effect Sensor**: A sensor positioned near the turbine detects the changes in the magnetic field as the turbine rotates.\n",
    "3. **Pulse Counting**: The sensor generates a series of electrical pulses, where the frequency of the pulses corresponds to the rotational speed of the turbine.\n",
    "4. **Meter Constant (K-Factor)**: The turbine and sensor assembly has a meter constant (K-factor), defined as the number of pulses generated per unit of flow. This constant is used to convert the pulse frequency into a mass or volume flow rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is then processed by a microcontroller or data acquisition system to display the flow rate in appropriate units.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Low-inertia turbines minimize lag, allowing precise measurement even at low flow rates.\n",
    "- **Compact and Scalable**: Mass flow meters are available in a wide range of sizes and capacities, suitable for different applications.\n",
    "- **Digital Output**: The pulse-based output is easy to integrate with modern control systems and data loggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Engineering Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Mass flow meters are versatile and widely used across industries. Some common applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Water and Wastewater Treatment**\n",
    "   - Monitoring the flow of water, effluent, and chemicals in treatment plants.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "Flow measurement is a fundamental aspect of fluid mechanics, used to quantify the movement of fluid in a system. Several methods exist for measuring flow rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Venturi Meter\n",
    "The Venturi meter employs a combination of a converging tube, throat, and diverging tube to measure flow rate. The pressure differential between the inlet and throat, caused by differing diameters, is used to calculate discharge. This method minimizes energy loss and adheres to the continuity and Bernoulli equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orifice Plate Meter\n",
    "An orifice plate meter utilizes a round opening in a plate inserted into the flow path. By measuring the head loss upstream and downstream of the plate, the flow rate can be determined using a discharge coefficient and continuity principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rotameter\n",
    "The rotameter is a variable-area flow meter, where the position of a float within a tapered tube indicates flow rate. The float reaches equilibrium based on the balance between drag force and its weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mass Flow Meter\n",
    "Mass flow meters measure flow directly using near-zero-inertia turbines. These turbines generate digital pulses correlated with flow rate, making this method suitable for high-accuracy applications.\n",
