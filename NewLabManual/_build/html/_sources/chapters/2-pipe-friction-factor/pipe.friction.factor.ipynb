    "It is nearly impossible for turbulent flow to occur at Reynolds number less\n",
    "than 2000 as the turbulence will be restrained by the viscous resistance.\n",
    "However, there is a stage when laminar flow is becoming turbulent or turbulent is becoming laminar. This is transitional flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "For smooth pipes, the common classifications are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Laminar Flow: $Re < 2000$\n",
    "- Transitional Flow: $2000 \\le Re \\le 4000$\n",
    "- Turbulent Flow: $Re > 4000$\n",

    "Osborne Reynolds, a British physicist and engineer, conducted his famous experiment in 1883 to study the transition between laminar and turbulent flow in pipes. His setup included a glass tube through which water flowed, with a small stream of dye introduced at the inlet. By varying the flow rate, Reynolds observed that:\n",
    "- At low velocities, the dye remained as a smooth, straight line, indicating laminar flow.\n",
    "- At higher velocities, the dye became irregular and dispersed, showing turbulent flow.\n",
    "- Between these two states, he noted a transitional phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "From his observations, Reynolds formulated a dimensionless number—now known as the Reynolds number ($Re_D$)—to characterize flow behavior. This number combines fluid properties (density and viscosity), flow velocity, and a characteristic length (such as pipe diameter). \n",

    "## Friction Factors in Fluid Flow (Pipeline Losses)\n",
    "\n",
    "Friction factors quantify the resistance to flow in closed (pipes, ducts) and open conduits (sewers, streams, flumes) from internal shear forces and surface roughness. Different models have been developed to describe friction losses under various conditions, with the most notable being the Darcy-Weisbach equation, the Chezy-Manning equation, and the Hazen-Williams equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Darcy-Weisbach Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Darcy-Weisbach equation is the **most fundamental** and widely applicable model for frictional head loss in pipes. It expresses the head loss ($h_f$) due to friction as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_f=f\\frac{L}{D}\\frac{v^2}{2g}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $f$: Darcy friction factor (dimensionless)\n",
    "- $L$: Pipe length\n",
    "- $D$: Pipe diameter\n",
    "- $V$: Flow velocity\n",
    "- $g$: Gravitational acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "The Darcy friction factor ($f$) depends on the Reynolds number ($Re$) and the relative roughness ($k/D$) of the pipe. For laminar flow ($Re<2000$), $f$ is directly proportional to $Re^{-1}$. For transitional and turbulent flow ($Re>2000$), empirical correlations like the Colebrook-White equation or the Moody chart are used to determine $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Chezy-Manning Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chezy-Manning equation is typically used in open channel flow analysis. It relates the flow velocity ($v$) to the hydraulic radius ($R_h$) and slope of the energy gradient ($S_f$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v=\\frac{1}{n} {R_h}^{2/3}{S_f}^{1/2}$$\n",

    "- $R_h$: Hydraulic radius (A/PA/P, where AA is the flow area and PP is the wetted perimeter)\n",
    "- $S_f$: Energy slope (head loss per unit length)\n",
    "\n",
    "Manning's $n$ is an empirical coefficient that accounts for channel roughness, with values typically determined from tabulated data for different materials (e.g., concrete, soil, vegetation).\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Rearranged as a head loss equation, Manning's Equation (SI Units) is\n",
    "\n",

    "There are some references that relate roughness properties to Manning's $n$. (CITE Limneros)\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Hazen-Williams Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hazen-Williams equation is an empirical formula widely used in water distribution systems (common in the USA, and some commonwealth nations). It estimates flow velocity ($v$) or discharge ($Q$) based on pipe roughness and diameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v=kCD^{0.63}S^{0.54}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or equivalently:\n",
    "$Q=kCD^{2.63}S^{0.54}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $C$: Hazen-Williams roughness coefficient\n",
    "- $k$: Unit conversion constant\n",
    "- $D$: Pipe diameter\n",
    "- $S$: Hydraulic slope\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hazen-Williams coefficient ($C$) is specific to pipe material and condition, with higher values indicating smoother pipes. Unlike the Darcy-Weisbach equation, this formula is limited to turbulent flow in water systems and assumes a fixed dependency on flow conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- Darcy-Weisbach: The most theoretically consistent with fluid mechanics.  It is versatile, applicable to all fluids, flow regimes, and pipe conditions. Requires iterative solutions in turbulent flow due to its dependence on $Re$ and $k/D$.\n",
    "- Chezy-Manning: Ideal for open channel flows. It simplifies calculations by focusing on geometric and material properties but lacks general applicability to pressurized flows.\n",
    "- Hazen-Williams: Convenient for design purposes in water supply systems but is inaccurate for extreme conditions or non-water fluids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Darcy-Weisbach: Pipe design in chemical, mechanical, and civil engineering.\n",
    "- Chezy-Manning: Hydraulic analysis of natural streams, irrigation channels, and culverts.\n",
    "- Hazen-Williams: Urban water distribution networks and large pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The friction factor in the laboratory will be determined using the Darcy-Weisbach model where, $f$ can be found as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f = \\frac{2 \\Delta h~g D}{L v^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The necessary physical water properties corresponding to water temperature\n",
    "should be used. They can be found in tables such as [http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/fluidmechanics/WaterPropertiesUS/WaterPropertiesUS.html](http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/fluidmechanics/WaterPropertiesUS/WaterPropertiesUS.html), or from any fluid mechanics textbook.\n",
