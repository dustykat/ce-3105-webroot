    "\n",
    "Friction factors quantify the resistance to flow in closed (pipes, ducts) and open conduits (sewers, streams, flumes) from internal shear forces and surface roughness. Different models have been developed to describe friction losses under various conditions, with the most notable being the Darcy-Weisbach equation, the Chezy-Manning equation, and the Hazen-Williams equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Darcy-Weisbach Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Darcy-Weisbach equation is the **most fundamental** and widely applicable model for frictional head loss in pipes. It expresses the head loss ($h_f$) due to friction as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_f=f\\frac{L}{D}\\frac{v^2}{2g}$$\n",

    "- $L$: Pipe length\n",
    "- $D$: Pipe diameter\n",
    "- $V$: Flow velocity\n",
    "- $g$: Gravitational acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "The Darcy friction factor ($f$) depends on the Reynolds number ($Re$) and the relative roughness ($k/D$) of the pipe. For laminar flow ($Re<2000$), $f$ is directly proportional to $Re^{-1}$. For transitional and turbulent flow ($Re>2000$), empirical correlations like the Colebrook-White equation or the Moody chart are used to determine $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Chezy-Manning Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chezy-Manning equation is typically used in open channel flow analysis. It relates the flow velocity ($v$) to the hydraulic radius ($R_h$) and slope of the energy gradient ($S_f$):\n",

    "- $k$: Unit conversion constant\n",
    "- $D$: Pipe diameter\n",
    "- $S$: Hydraulic slope\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hazen-Williams coefficient ($C$) is specific to pipe material and condition, with higher values indicating smoother pipes. Unlike the Darcy-Weisbach equation, this formula is limited to turbulent flow in water systems and assumes a fixed dependency on flow conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- Darcy-Weisbach: The most theoretically consistent with fluid mechanics.  It is versatile, applicable to all fluids, flow regimes, and pipe conditions. Requires iterative solutions in turbulent flow due to its dependence on $Re$ and $k/D$.\n",
    "- Chezy-Manning: Ideal for open channel flows. It simplifies calculations by focusing on geometric and material properties but lacks general applicability to pressurized flows.\n",
    "- Hazen-Williams: Convenient for design purposes in water supply systems but is inaccurate for extreme conditions or non-water fluids.\n",

    "- Darcy-Weisbach: Pipe design in chemical, mechanical, and civil engineering.\n",
    "- Chezy-Manning: Hydraulic analysis of natural streams, irrigation channels, and culverts.\n",
    "- Hazen-Williams: Urban water distribution networks and large pipelines.\n",
