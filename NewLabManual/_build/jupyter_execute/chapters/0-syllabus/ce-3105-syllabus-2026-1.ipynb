    "This course aims to enhance students’ understanding of the behavior of real fluids and their interactions with physical systems through hands-on experimentation and theoretical analysis. By engaging in the experimental method, students will develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The course also emphasizes improving technical writing proficiency and preparing students for the fluid mechanics section of the FE Exam. Collaborative group work is a cornerstone of this course, with peer assessment contributing to a portion of the final grade."

    "5. Apply the principles of conservation of mass, energy, and momentum to control volumes.\n",
    "6. Predict the effects of channel transitions, such as changes in width or bed level, in open channel flow problems.\n",
    "7. Compare and contrast the behavior of real and theoretical fluids based on experimental observations.\n",
    "8. Develop step-by-step protocols for conducting fluid mechanics experiments and collecting reliable data.\n",
    "9. Measure values such as head, discharge, and fluid properties using legacy techniques to support calculations involving conservation laws.\n",
    "10. Measure values such as pressure and discharge using modern automated methods, including DIY data loggers and digital and analog sensors, to support conservation law applications.\n",
