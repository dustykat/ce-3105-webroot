Then the sample is weighed, and the average rate of mass flow is $\\frac{ \\rho g \\Delta V}{\\Delta t}$, where $ \\rho g \\Delta V$ is the weight of the sample. \n",

Inside the cap is a hall detector (a coil) that converts the rotating magnetic field into a digital pulse that the microprocessor can count.

    "## Background\n",
    "Flow measurement is a fundamental aspect of fluid mechanics, used to quantify the movement of fluid in a system. Several methods exist for measuring flow rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Venturi Meter\n",
    "The Venturi meter employs a combination of a converging tube, throat, and diverging tube to measure flow rate. The pressure differential between the inlet and throat, caused by differing diameters, is used to calculate discharge. This method minimizes energy loss and adheres to the continuity and Bernoulli equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orifice Plate Meter\n",
    "An orifice plate meter utilizes a round opening in a plate inserted into the flow path. By measuring the head loss upstream and downstream of the plate, the flow rate can be determined using a discharge coefficient and continuity principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rotameter\n",
    "The rotameter is a variable-area flow meter, where the position of a float within a tapered tube indicates flow rate. The float reaches equilibrium based on the balance between drag force and its weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mass Flow Meter\n",
    "Mass flow meters measure flow directly using near-zero-inertia turbines. These turbines generate digital pulses correlated with flow rate, making this method suitable for high-accuracy applications.\n",
