## General Feedback

This is an excellent and complete report on minor losses in pipe systems. The team clearly understood the objective, executed the data collection carefully, and provided thorough data analysis. The inclusion of calculated K-values across multiple fittings adds strength to the report, and the discussion supports observed differences well. The only areas needing improvement are brief clarification on velocity/dimension choice for expansion/contraction fittings and further discussion on unit conversion error risks.

##  Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective** — **10/10**
-  Clear and relevant statement of intent, focusing on energy losses due to fittings and their quantification via loss coefficients.

### 2. **Theory and Background** — **10/10**
-  Well-articulated explanation of fitting loss mechanisms.
-  Appropriately introduces the concept of velocity head and the definition of the loss coefficient K.

### 3. **Materials and Methods** — **10/10**
-  Proper enumeration of fittings, instruments, and procedure.
-  Emphasizes the use of both time-to-fill and flowmeter counts.

### 4. **Results and Data Analysis** — **9/10**
-  Data are presented in structured tables.
-  Correct computation of K-values using measured head loss and velocity head.
- A brief explanation of which diameter was used for velocity in expansion/contraction fittings would improve clarity.
- No indication of error propagation or uncertainty in the K-values, though results are very reasonable.

### 5. **Discussion** — **10/10**
-  Effectively relates results to expected performance of fittings (e.g., mitre has high loss due to sharp turn).
-  Addresses manometer errors, especially air bubbles in Trial 1.
-  Acknowledges variations between trials and attributes them to valve changes and flow instability.

### 6. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
-  Succinct and technically accurate.
-  Ties the experiment to real-world implications and system design.

### 7. **References and Attribution** — **6/10**
-  Uses course material as a valid reference.
- Effort attribution is missing—no signed effort sheet or division of labor mentioned.

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **10/10**
-  The report is professionally written and logically structured.
-  No significant errors in formatting, grammar, or spelling.

## Summary of Loss Coefficients (K-values)

| Fitting Type       | Average K (Computed) | Expected Range | Notes                        |
|--------------------|----------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Mitre Bend         | 1.74                 | ~1.1–2.0       | Sharp bend, high loss        |
| Elbow              | 1.43                 | ~0.6–1.5       | Moderate loss                |
| Large Radius Bend  | 1.47                 | ~0.2–0.6       | Higher than expected         |
| Expansion Joint    | 0.43                 | ~0.3–1.0       | Matches theory               |
| Contraction Joint  | 1.46                 | ~0.4–1.2       | Slightly high, diameter unclear |
