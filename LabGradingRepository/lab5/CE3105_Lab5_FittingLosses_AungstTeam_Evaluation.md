## General Feedback

This is a strong and well-written report that effectively communicates the objectives and theoretical foundations of fitting loss evaluation. The discussion clearly connects the observed behavior to geometry and flow conditions. However, the report would benefit from improved data presentation, especially clear tables of computed loss coefficients (K-values), and clarification regarding diameter selection for expansion/contraction fittings. Additionally, measurement uncertainty and unit conversions should be more rigorously treated.

##  Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective** — **10/10**
-  Clearly defined, with emphasis on flow, pressure loss, geometry, and coefficient estimation.

### 2. **Theory and Background** — **10/10**
-  Provides an appropriate overview of fitting losses and their dependence on velocity and geometry.
-  Effectively explains the purpose of comparing real and theoretical K-values.

### 3. **Materials and Methods** — **9/10**
-  Tools and devices are clearly listed, including diameters and radii.
- Clarify flow measurement process (time-to-fill vs. meter) and diameter used for expansions/contractions.

### 4. **Results and Data Analysis** — **7/10**
- No tables with computed K-values were included.
- Figure 1.1 (V vs. ΔP) is mentioned but not visible or explained.
- Diameter confusion (22 mm vs. 28.4 mm) not acknowledged or handled explicitly.
- Unclear whether pressure drop was converted into head loss and used with correct velocity.

### 5. **Discussion** — **9/10**
-  Strong conceptual analysis of why specific fittings have higher or lower K-values.
-  Notes experimental challenges such as air bubbles and flow instability.
- Could explicitly mention unit conversion errors or reinforce why time-to-fill was chosen as the preferred flow rate.

### 6. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
-  Ties together learning outcomes and emphasizes design implications.
-  Highlights contrast in loss behavior across fittings effectively.

### 7. **References and Attribution** — **7/10**
-  Reference to lab manual is appropriate.
- Missing detailed attribution of group effort (signed sheet or breakdown of contributions).

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **8/10**
-  Overall writing is professional and well-structured.
- Some section headings ("Data Analysis", "Table 1.1") feel like placeholders—data and plots should be inserted or referenced clearly.
- Minor issues with spacing and repeated phrasing.

| Large Radius Bend   | ---     | ---              | ---            | ---           | ~0.2–0.4       | Low due to smooth turn      |
| Sudden Contraction  | ---     | ---              | ---            | ---           | ~0.5–2.0       | Diameter ratio not clarified |
| Sudden Expansion    | ---     | ---              | ---            | ---           | ~0.6–1.5       | K depends on velocity loss  |
