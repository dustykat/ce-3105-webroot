## General Feedback

This is a technically strong report with clear procedures, complete data, and consistent alignment with the learning objectives of Lab 5. The loss coefficients are calculated and discussed in meaningful context. The results support expected design implications, such as the performance benefits of smoother bends. A few areas—especially table formatting and justification of anomalous K-values (e.g., elbow and bend outliers)—could be strengthened to improve technical polish and clarity.

##  Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective and Introduction** — **10/10**
-  Clearly stated objective regarding minor losses in bends, expansions, and contractions.
-  Ties to real-world relevance in pipe network design.

### 2. **Theory and Background** — **10/10**
-  Strong explanation of energy loss in expansions, contractions, and bends.
-  Correct theoretical basis for loss coefficient (K = hL / (V² / 2g)) with velocity conventions for each case.

### 3. **Materials and Methods** — **10/10**
-  Step-by-step procedure provided with appropriate instrumentation listed.
-  Measurement method (time-to-fill and manometer) properly described.

### 4. **Results and Data Analysis** — **8/10**
-  Raw data is well structured and includes velocity head and Δh values.
-  K-values computed for all fittings, presented in summary form.
- Negative K-values (e.g., elbow = –2.19, bend = –2.19) are shown without adequate discussion or data filtering.
- Table formatting could be improved with better units and column alignment.

### 5. **Discussion** — **9/10**
-  Insightful comparisons made between experimental and theoretical K-values.
-  Reasoning provided for differences, including expected turbulence and energy loss by fitting type.
- Anomalous results such as negative K-values should be analyzed more rigorously—possible causes (e.g., pressure sensor inversion, noisy manometer reading) should be offered.

### 6. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
-  Concludes that bends are best based on experimental data and design efficiency.
-  Emphasizes practical understanding of losses in system design.

### 7. **References and Attribution** — **10/10**
-  Cites textbook, course notes, and fluid properties reference.
-  Effort record included and clearly broken down by task.

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **9/10**
-  Overall clear, concise writing.
- Minor formatting artifacts (spacing in tables and formulas) should be cleaned up for professional presentation.

## Summary of K-Values

| Fitting Type         | Avg. K (Reported) | Theoretical Range | Notes                            |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Mitre                | 2.26              | 1.4 – 1.6         | Slightly high but plausible      |
| Elbow                | 1.09              | 1.1 – 1.4         | On lower edge, one negative outlier |
| Bend                 | 0.15              | 0.2 – 0.6         | Low; negative value likely skews average |
| Enlargement          | 0.20              | 0.3 – 1.0         | Slightly low, reasonable         |
| Contraction          | 1.11              | 0.4 – 1.2         | Within expected range            |
