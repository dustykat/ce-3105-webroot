## ✅ General Feedback

This is a well-structured and analytically strong report. The team demonstrates a sound understanding of minor losses, calculates loss coefficients appropriately, and interprets the trends observed in fittings well. There are clear efforts to validate results through comparison to standards, and a thoughtful treatment of error sources is present. Some small inconsistencies in table presentation and misinterpretation of velocity diameter references in expansions/contractions could be improved.

## 🧾 Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective and Introduction** — **10/10**
- ✔ Clear, concise statement of goals and relevance to real-world pipe system design.
- ✔ Correct framing of minor losses vs. major losses.

### 2. **Theory and Background** — **10/10**
- ✔ Thorough treatment of fluid mechanics principles.
- ✔ Proper use of Darcy-Weisbach and K-loss formulations.
- ✔ Fitting descriptions are accurate and tied to expected behavior.

### 3. **Materials and Methods** — **10/10**
- ✔ Comprehensive list of equipment.
- ✔ Flow measurement with time-to-fill and discussion of flow meter limitations.
- ✔ Good procedural clarity.

### 4. **Results and Data Analysis** — **8/10**
- ✔ Includes tables of velocity, flow rate, head loss, and computed K values.
- ❗Head loss values for enlargement fitting are negative and are not clearly addressed in the results section.
- ❗K-values for elbow and long sweep are slightly beyond expected ranges, which should be noted as possible instrument error or scale issue.
- ❗Velocity reference for K-calculations (e.g., upstream vs. downstream diameter) should be clarified for expansions/contractions.

### 5. **Discussion** — **9/10**
- ✔ Effectively connects head loss to geometry and flow speed.
- ✔ Highlights high-loss in miter fitting and low-loss in long sweep elbows as expected.
- ❗Says long sweep K was 0.736, though table averages show 0.236 — probable typo.
- ❗Negative head loss values discussed later but should be emphasized more clearly in the analysis.

### 6. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
- ✔ Reinforces experimental learning, including the design implications of fitting choices.
- ✔ Summarizes experimental alignment with theory.

### 7. **References and Attribution** — **6/10**
- ✔ Reference to the correct course page.
- ❗Attribution missing or not formally signed by each participant.
- ❗Duplicate entries in reference list.

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **10/10**
- ✔ Readable, well-formatted, and free of major grammatical issues.
- ✔ Charts, equations, and figures are appropriately labeled and cited.

## 📊 Suggested K-Value Summary Table

| Fitting              | Avg. K (Computed) | Expected K Range | Notes                            |
|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Miter Bend           | 1.081             | 0.9 – 1.5        | Excellent agreement              |
| Elbow                | 0.477             | 0.3 – 0.9        | Good agreement                   |
| Long Sweep Elbow     | 0.236             | 0.2 – 0.6        | Within expected range            |
| Expansion Fitting    | — (Neg Δh)        | 0.3 – 1.0        | Negative value, system error     |
| Contraction Fitting  | — (Neg Δh)        | 0.4 – 1.2        | Likely flow artifact             |
