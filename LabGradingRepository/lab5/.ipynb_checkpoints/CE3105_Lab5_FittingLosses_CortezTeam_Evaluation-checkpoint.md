## ✅ General Feedback

This report provides a technically clear and well-reasoned exploration of minor losses due to pipe fittings. The team accurately presents theoretical background, carries out calculations with clarity, and discusses experimental implications with insight. The structure is clean and well-cited, and attribution is complete. Minor areas for improvement include clarification on units, expanded commentary on the K-value magnitude (especially for contraction and enlargement fittings), and more emphasis on digit...

## 🧾 Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective and Introduction** — **10/10**
- ✔ Clear articulation of the experiment’s purpose: evaluating energy loss across pipe fittings and understanding associated fluid dynamics.

### 2. **Theory and Background** — **10/10**
- ✔ Includes correct theoretical expressions for head loss and loss coefficients.
- ✔ Good explanation of physical mechanisms behind losses in expansion and contraction.

### 3. **Materials and Procedure** — **9/10**
- ✔ Well-described steps using both manometers and Raspberry Pi data acquisition.
- ❗Flow conditions and trial control methods (valve settings, stabilization time) could be expanded for replication.

### 4. **Results and Data Analysis** — **9/10**
- ✔ K-values are clearly calculated for each fitting type.
- ✔ Sample calculations provided and match reported results.
- ❗Unit clarity could be improved in the velocity and head loss table.
- ❗While K-values are calculated, the unusual low values for elbow/contraction should be briefly flagged as potential underestimations.
