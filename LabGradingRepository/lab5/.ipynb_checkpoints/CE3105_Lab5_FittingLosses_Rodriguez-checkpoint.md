| **Completeness**       | 4                | All required sections included.                                          |
| **Technical Accuracy** | 4                | Correct use of theory and interpretation, though equations are missing formatting. |
| **Writing Quality**    | 4                | Well-written, though could benefit from more concise technical expression. |
| **Data Presentation**  | 3                | Data is presented, but table lacks labels, units, and clarity in headings. |
| **Analysis & Discussion** | 4            | Interpretation of results aligns with theory; considers design implications. |
| **Formatting and Structure** | 3         | Structure is logical, but formatting (tables, equations) needs attention. |
| **Grammar and Style**  | 4                | Minor grammar issues, generally professional tone.                       |

## Final Thoughts

The report is solid and reflects a competent understanding of minor losses and their implications in fluid systems. Future improvements could include:

- Proper formatting of equations using LaTeX/Markdown.
- Labeling all tables and figures clearly with units and context.
- Clarifying which diameter was used in expansions/contractions for velocity calculation.
- Highlighting practical measurement challenges (e.g., manometer issues) more directly.

Overall, a well-constructed and thoughtful report. Good work!
