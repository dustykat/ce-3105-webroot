## General Feedback

This is an excellent and complete report that demonstrates solid understanding, accurate computation, and strong alignment with theoretical expectations. The loss coefficients for various fittings were calculated, compared against literature ranges, and interpreted meaningfully. Visualizations are included and provide a compelling way to compare Δh vs. velocity for each fitting. With minor formatting and labeling improvements, this could serve as a template report for Lab 5.

##  Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective and Introduction** — **10/10**
-  Clear and focused objective: determining loss coefficients for multiple pipe fittings.

### 2. **Theory and Background** — **10/10**
-  Solid application of the energy loss equation: ΔH = K * V² / (2g).
-  Good explanation of minor loss sources and distinctions between fittings.

### 3. **Materials and Methods** — **10/10**
-  Detailed procedural steps provided.
-  Emphasizes both manual and electronic instrumentation (manometer, stopwatch).

### 4. **Results and Data Analysis** — **9/10**
-  K-values calculated and clearly shown.
-  Data tables are well-organized.
- Expansion fitting showed negative Δh and negative K-values — this is acknowledged but could benefit from more technical analysis (e.g., measurement error, reference pressure discussion).
- Graphs are referenced but could use axis labels, titles, and captions for better readability.

### 5. **Discussion** — **10/10**
-  Excellent interpretation of why different fittings show higher or lower losses.
-  Correctly identifies mitre and contraction fittings as more turbulent and loss-prone.
-  Recognizes that large radius bends reduce turbulence and improve efficiency.

### 6. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
-  Well-crafted and theory-aligned.
-  Emphasizes practical implications for pipe network design.

### 7. **References and Attribution** — **9/10**
-  References to lab notes and experimental methods texts are provided.
-  Fully signed and itemized effort sheet included.
- Citation formatting could be more consistent (APA/IEEE/etc.).

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **8/10**
-  Generally strong writing.
- Minor grammar inconsistencies (e.g., missing articles, prepositions).
- Some formatting artifacts in the plotted figures and data labels.

## Summary of Results (based on report)

| Fitting              | Average K | Theoretical Range | Notes                          |
|----------------------|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Mitre                | 2.06      | 1.4 – 1.6         | Slightly high, expected due to turbulence |
| Elbow                | 1.07      | 1.1 – 1.4         | Close to theoretical range     |
| Contraction          | 1.24      | 0.4 – 1.2         | Slightly high                  |
| Enlargement          | -0.28     | 0.3 – 1.0         | Negative K, potentially due to reference pressure misalignment |
| Large Radius Bend    | 0.60      | 0.2 – 0.8         | Good agreement                 |
