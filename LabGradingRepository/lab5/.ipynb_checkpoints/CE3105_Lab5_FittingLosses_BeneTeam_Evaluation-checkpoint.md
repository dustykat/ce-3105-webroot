## ✅ General Feedback

This report demonstrates a solid understanding of pipe fitting losses and applies both manual and electronic data collection techniques effectively. The team correctly implements flow measurements, derives K-values for fittings, and offers meaningful interpretations tied to theoretical benchmarks. The report is well-structured and the error discussion is thorough. Some formatting clarity and graph/data visualization improvements would further strengthen it.

## 🧾 Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective and Introduction** — **10/10**
- ✔ Well-articulated objective with a strong emphasis on real-world application of minimizing energy loss in pipe networks.
- ✔ Practical motivation tied to fluid efficiency and pump system design.

### 2. **Theory and Background** — **10/10**
- ✔ Includes sound derivation of K-values, including contraction/expansion theory.
- ✔ References importance of R/D ratios and head loss correlation.

### 3. **Materials and Methods** — **10/10**
- ✔ Good procedural breakdown using both stopwatch and Raspberry Pi flow data.
- ✔ Clearly explains fitting sequence and manometer use.

### 4. **Results and Data Analysis** — **8/10**
- ✔ Provides head loss values, velocities, and includes example K-value calculations.
- ✔ Observes and flags negative head loss values, appropriately converting to positive.
- ❗Final summary table with K-values per fitting is implied but not included — would be useful for quick comparison.
- ❗Plots and figures are referenced but not embedded or captioned clearly.

### 5. **Discussion** — **9/10**
- ✔ Correct ranking and trend interpretation of fittings: Bend > Elbow > Mitre > Contraction > Expansion.
- ✔ Theoretical vs experimental values discussed, with attention to R/D effects and turbulence.
- ❗Negative K-values briefly addressed — could expand explanation or propose instrumentation limitations more formally.

### 6. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
- ✔ Clearly summarizes findings and offers good design implications for real systems.
- ✔ Correctly identifies large-radius bends as most efficient fitting.

### 7. **References and Attribution** — **10/10**
- ✔ Proper course reference provided and effort sheet included with signatures.

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **7/10**
- ❗Several typos, minor grammar issues, and inconsistencies in table units/labels.
- ❗Better equation formatting and graph integration would increase technical polish.

## 📊 Suggested Summary Table (To Include)

| Fitting              | K (Reported) | Theoretical K | Notes                              |
|----------------------|--------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Mitre                | ~1.5         | ~1.3           | Higher, likely due to turbulence   |
| Elbow                | ~1.8         | ~0.9           | Significantly high, geometry-dependent |
| Bend                 | ~2.2         | 0.2–0.5        | High due to tight radius           |
| Expansion            | ~0.38        | ~0.16          | Slightly elevated, expected        |
| Contraction          | ~1.3         | ~0.2           | Vena contracta effect observed     |
