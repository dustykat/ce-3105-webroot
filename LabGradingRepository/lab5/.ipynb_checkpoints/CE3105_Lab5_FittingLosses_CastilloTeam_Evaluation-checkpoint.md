## General Feedback

This report is concise, well-structured, and technically sound. The team demonstrates a clear understanding of minor losses in piping systems and successfully calculates loss coefficients for various fittings. The theoretical foundations are strong, and the data trends align well with expectations. Additional detail in the presentation of plots, expanded K-value tabulation, and more critical commentary on the unusually low deviations (e.g., mitre fitting K slightly under expected) would strengthen the r...

## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective and Introduction** — **10/10**
-  Clearly identifies the purpose: to determine head losses in bends, expansions, and contractions.
-  Tied to application in system design.

### 2. **Theory and Background** — **9/10**
-  Introduces the K-value concept and loss coefficient relationships.
-Some notation formatting (e.g., R/D and K relations) is a bit fragmented and could be made clearer.

### 3. **Materials and Methods** — **10/10**
-  Excellent procedural clarity with steps to obtain pressure readings and flowrate from time-to-fill.
-  Appropriate handling of equipment and controlled variation in valve positions.

### 4. **Results and Data Analysis** — **9/10**
-  Presents flow rates, manometer readings, and interpreted head loss data.
-  Graphs are described in narrative; however, the graphs themselves are not rendered in the report text.
-A summary table of computed K-values would help synthesize and validate the findings quantitatively.
-Expansion/contraction pressure differences not explicitly broken out by section.

### 5. **Discussion** — **9/10**
-  Accurate interpretation of mitre, elbow, and bend results.
-  Good qualitative explanation of pipe geometry and energy loss.
-Expansion/contraction analysis was more conceptual and less rigorous than the directional fittings.
-Could elaborate more on the slight deviation in mitre bend K vs. theory.

### 6. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
-  Synthesizes experimental findings effectively.
-  Identifies large radius bends as best for minimizing head loss.
-  Connects velocity head loss trends to physical pipe design.

### 7. **References and Attribution** — **8/10**
-  Core concepts referenced to lab documentation.
-No clear attribution sheet or reference to external sources (e.g., Moody chart, textbook).

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **8/10**
-  Writing is mostly clear and well-structured.
-Some transitions and equation formatting could be cleaner for readability.
-A few minor grammar errors in phrasing (e.g., “this wrap” instead of “this lab”).

| Fitting              | K (Calculated) | K (Theoretical Range) | Notes                            |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Elbow                | 1.327          | 1.1 – 1.4              | Excellent agreement              |
| Mitre                | 1.371          | 1.4 – 1.6              | Slight underprediction           |
| Large Radius Bend    | 0.663          | 0.2 – 0.8              | Matches expected low loss        |

##  Final Score: **93 / 100**

### **Strengths**
- Good structure and clean methodology
- Correct application of velocity head theory
- Graph-based extraction of K-values well executed

###  **Areas to Improve**
- Include tables or appendices with actual K-values for all fittings
- Clarify notation and refine plot inclusion
- Add attribution and citations to elevate technical depth

ting and data visualization improvements, this would serve as a reference report.
