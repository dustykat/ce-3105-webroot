## ✅ General Feedback

This is a thoughtful and complete report that does a good job of addressing the objectives and theoretical underpinnings of minor (fitting) losses. The team demonstrates strong experimental awareness, offers useful error analysis, and interprets the trends observed in the manometer readings appropriately. There are a few issues with clarity in tabular presentation and analysis of specific K-values. Nonetheless, this is a solid technical submission with practical insights and commendable teamwork.

## 🧾 Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective and Introduction** — **10/10**
- ✔ Clear, concise, and connected to real-world engineering systems.

### 2. **Theory and Background** — **10/10**
- ✔ Covers Darcy-Weisbach equation and minor loss coefficients effectively.
- ✔ Explains the cause and behavior of losses at bends, expansions, and contractions.

### 3. **Materials and Methods** — **10/10**
- ✔ Describes fittings, flow devices, manometers, and Raspberry Pi instrumentation.
- ✔ Good procedure breakdown with recognition of indoor controlled conditions.

### 4. **Results and Data Analysis** — **8/10**
- ✔ Tables present all relevant values including flow rate and pressure head.
- ❗No explicit K-values are shown or calculated.
- ❗Analysis notes increasing pressure loss with increasing flow but does not quantify loss coefficients by fitting.
- ❗Manometer behavior is described but not linked clearly to specific fittings.

### 5. **Discussion** — **9/10**
- ✔ Strong recognition of turbulent and nonlinear behavior across fittings.
- ✔ Validates observed error magnitudes and aligns qualitative outcomes with theory.
- ❗Expansion/contraction effects could be more explicitly discussed in terms of area change and velocity assignment.

### 6. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
- ✔ Well-supported summary of practical findings and theoretical alignment.
- ✔ Suggestions for improvement (digital sensors, better sealing, purging) are practical and valuable.

### 7. **References and Attribution** — **10/10**
- ✔ Complete reference list and fully signed effort sheet.
- ✔ Clear breakdown of team contributions.

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **9/10**
- ✔ Professional tone and clear section organization.
- ❗Some phrasing in the analysis section could be tightened, and visuals (tables, plots) would benefit from stronger formatting.
