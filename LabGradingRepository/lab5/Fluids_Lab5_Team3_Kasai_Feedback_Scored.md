## Evaluation Summary

### Strengths:
- Experimental procedure is correctly described and followed.
- Key calculations were completed and relevant data tables were included.
- Flow behavior is linked to pipe geometry in the conclusion.
- Data capture appears consistent across trials with increasing flow rates.

### Areas for Improvement:
- The report does not explicitly **affirm the reliability of the mass flowmeter** compared to the time-to-fill method.
- **Manometer difficulties** were only briefly mentioned; this should have been highlighted more clearly as a known source of error.
- **Loss coefficient values** are not compared to typical values in literature or included in discussion with numerical ranges (e.g., K ≈ 1.1 to 10).
- **Fitting diameter usage for velocity calculation** in expansion/contraction fittings was not addressed or clarified.
- **Tables lack proper headings and units**, making interpretation difficult.
- The document retains **raw Jupyter formatting**, detracting from polish and readability.
- A few **grammatical and structural issues** were present (e.g., inconsistent formatting of headings and units).

## Recommendations:
For future reports:
- Compare your calculated K values with expected ranges from literature to validate accuracy.
- Clearly distinguish between flow rate measurement methods and affirm which is most trustworthy.
- Explicitly note difficulty in manometer readings and its effects on data accuracy.
- Clarify which diameter was used for velocity in fittings that involve a change in cross-section.
- Clean and format data tables, ensuring all variables include units and column headings.
- Convert Jupyter notebook content into formal lab report style before submission.

With stronger formatting and more focus on interpreting results in context, this would be a very strong report.
