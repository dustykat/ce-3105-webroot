## Evaluation Summary

| Category              | Score (out of 5) | Comments                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Completeness**       | 4                | All core sections present, but lacks a clearly labeled 'Objective' section. |
| **Technical Accuracy** | 4                | Equations and concepts are sound; clear understanding of fitting losses. |
| **Writing Quality**    | 4                | Writing is readable and coherent; could benefit from visual aids and subheadings. |
| **Data Presentation**  | 3                | Data tables are incomplete—lack units, labels, or fitted summary. |
| **Analysis & Discussion** | 4            | Good qualitative comparison of results vs theory, with design insights. |
| **Formatting and Structure** | 3         | Report structure is functional but could be more polished with captions and figures. |
| **Grammar and Style**  | 4                | Few grammatical errors; style is appropriate for lab context.            |

## Final Thoughts

This report effectively describes and evaluates minor losses in pipe systems. The theory section is clearly written and correctly references fundamental relationships for calculating head loss and loss coefficients. The discussion demonstrates sound interpretation and design implications.

Areas for improvement:

- Include an explicit **Objective** section for clarity and consistency.
- Add **labels and units** to all data tables and reference them in the text.
- Provide **visual aids** such as diagrams or photos of fittings or equipment.
- Use **figure/table numbers and captions** to strengthen organization and referencing.

Overall, this is a well-developed report that reflects a strong grasp of the topic. Good effort!
