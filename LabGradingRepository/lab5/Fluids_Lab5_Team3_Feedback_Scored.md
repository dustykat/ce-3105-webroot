## Evaluation Summary

### Strengths:
- Theoretical background is well-described and references standard loss equations.
- Loss coefficients are calculated and appear mostly realistic.
- Discussion provides a reasonable interpretation of flow disturbance effects on K values.
- Observed trends align with expectations (larger R/D bends produce smaller losses).
- Writing is generally clear and professional.

### Areas for Improvement:
- The **objective** of the experiment is not clearly stated; this should be added to set the context.
- **Loss coefficient values**, while reported, are not explicitly compared to **literature benchmarks**.
- The **mass flowmeter vs time-to-fill** method distinction is only lightly discussed. It should be clearer that the mass flowmeter was more reliable.
- **Manometer readability issues** were acknowledged but not emphasized enough.
- **Expansion/contraction fittings** are discussed, but it's unclear which diameter was used to calculate velocity, which impacts K.
- **Data tables lack units and clear labels**, making interpretation harder.
- The report could benefit from **table and figure captions**, and better formatting for clarity.

## Recommendations:
To strengthen future reports:
- Start with a clear Objective section.
- Always compare experimental values (like K) with textbook or manual reference ranges.
- Emphasize which flow measurement method is preferred and why.
- Explicitly note instrumentation issues, such as manometer reading difficulty.
- Specify diameter choice and velocity basis in fittings with geometric changes.
- Label all data tables and figures, and provide units.
- Use formatting (e.g., subsections, bullet points, figure numbers) to improve readability.
