## General Feedback

This is a clear, thorough, and technically competent report. The team did a solid job of documenting flow measurements, calculating K-values for different fittings, and interpreting data trends against theoretical expectations. The inclusion of multiple graphs and a discussion around percent differences strengthens the analytical narrative. While data are well structured, there is room to improve in formatting and visual integration (e.g., plot labeling, unit consistency).

##  Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective and Introduction** — **10/10**
- Clearly states the learning goal: to investigate how fitting geometries influence head loss and to quantify loss coefficients.

### 2. **Theory and Background** — **10/10**
- Equations for K-values derived from ΔH and V²/2g are properly included.
- Appropriately describes contraction/expansion loss modeling and theoretical range expectations.

### 3. **Materials and Methods** — **10/10**
- Comprehensive description of tools and steps followed.
- Emphasis on safety, flow rate control, and pressure data collection.

### 4. **Results and Data Analysis** — **9/10**
- K-values presented in tabulated form with averages and comparisons.
- Data show good internal consistency; contraction K is constant, and others track trends.
- Negative slopes or inconsistent values on some plots (e.g., expansion/compression) should be better contextualized.
- Figure axis labels, units, and titles are missing from graphs.

### 5. **Discussion** — **9/10**
- Good analysis of turbulence effects and R/D ratio implications.
- Offers theory-consistent interpretation of K-values.
- The justification for why compression yields the lowest K-value needs more fluid-dynamics reasoning, not just empirical observation.
- Environmental factors like roughness are mentioned but not quantified or expanded upon.

### 6. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
- Reflects core findings and acknowledges limitations (e.g., manometer precision).
- Restates value of the experiment for applied hydraulics and energy efficiency understanding.

### 7. **References and Attribution** — **10/10**
- Two valid academic references are included.
- Proper formatting and credit to instructional materials.

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **9/10**
- Mostly clean writing and structured paragraphs.
- Some phrasing is a bit informal (“might have be”), and spacing in tables and figures can be enhanced.

| Elbow                | 1.81      | 1.1–1.4        | +~38%               | High, possibly due to turbulence  |
| Expansion            | 1.20      | ~0.44          | +46%                | Flow separation likely            |
| Compression          | 0.36      | ~0.16          | +38%                | Consistent, but higher than expected |
| Bend                 | 0.96      | 0.2–0.8        | ~+20–50%            | Matches trends, slightly high     |
