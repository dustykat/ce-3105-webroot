## General Feedback

This is a well-executed report, demonstrating strong understanding of fluid mechanics principles and careful attention to experimental detail. Manual and automated methods are clearly compared, and most relevant metrics are discussed. Including full data tables or plots would strengthen the analysis section, and formal referencing could be improved.

## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective and Introduction** — **10/10**
- Clearly outlines the experiment’s goals and theoretical context.

### 2. **Experimental Setup and Methods** — **9/10**
- Describes each method in detail, including instrumentation.
- Flow device calibration and pressure tap locations could be better specified.

### 3. **Results and Discussion** — **9/10**
- Comparisons made across devices are insightful and appropriate.
- Observations about low-flow measurement challenges are valuable.
- Missing visualizations (e.g., f vs. Re or ΔP vs. Q) which would enhance interpretability.
- The “f” values listed in results are unclear in units and not defined directly.

### 4. **Accuracy and Repeatability** — **9/10**
- Mean and standard deviation are referenced.
- Numerical results are not tabulated or graphed for clarity.

### 5. **Sources of Error** — **9/10**
- Accurately identifies realistic causes: timing, calibration, environmental variation.
- Impact of pipe roughness and head loss assumptions could be mentioned.

### 6. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
- Effectively summarizes findings and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of both manual and automated methods.

### 7. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **9/10**
- Professional tone and mostly well-structured.
- Some formatting inconsistencies due to notebook-export (e.g., “In [ ]:”) that should be cleaned in final report.

### 8. **References and Attribution** — **6/10**
- No proper citation list is included, and no effort sheet or attribution section is present.
- Course context is implied, but academic sources should be added.
