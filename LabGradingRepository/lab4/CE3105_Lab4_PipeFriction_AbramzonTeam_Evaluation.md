##  General Feedback

This is a technically robust and well-written report with strong analytical depth and a clear connection to fluid mechanics principles. The team demonstrated excellent data handling and reflected critically on the discrepancies in pressure measurement. The only significant improvements needed are better graphical data presentation and more systematic comparison to theoretical friction factor values.

##  Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective** — **10/10**
- Thorough and well-articulated objective, including instrumentation and accuracy assessments.

### 2. **Theory and Background** — **10/10**
- Covers Bernoulli, Reynolds number, and Darcy-Weisbach clearly.
- Applies theoretical framework correctly to support later analysis.

### 3. **Materials and Methods** — **10/10**
- Describes both manual and automated measurement techniques.
- Details protocols for pressure and flow rate measurements with redundancy.

### 4. **Results and Analysis** — **9/10**
- Includes time, pressure, and flow data in table form.
- Calculates Reynolds number and friction factor.
- Data would benefit from plotted results (e.g., friction factor vs. Re).
- Some inconsistencies in units and significant figures; clarify where possible.

### 5. **Discussion** — **9/10**
- Provides meaningful interpretation of discrepancies (e.g., manometer vs. handheld).
- Acknowledges instrumentation limits and proposes improvements.
- Could explicitly compare observed friction factor values to theoretical benchmarks like 64/Re or Moody chart ranges.

### 6. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
- Strong synthesis of theoretical and experimental findings.
- Clearly highlights learning outcomes and real-world relevance.

### 7. **References and Attribution** — **9/10**
- Includes valid textbook and lab manual references.
- Missing a signed effort attribution sheet.

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **6/10**
- Some raw formatting remains from draft (e.g., incomplete math rendering, equation artifacts).
- Several typographical and syntax issues should be cleaned up for final submission polish.
