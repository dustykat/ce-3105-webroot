##  General Feedback

The report is well-written, technically sound, and shows clear engagement with the key concepts of flow behavior and frictional loss analysis. The team successfully implemented multiple measurement techniques and analyzed flow conditions across different regimes. A few omissions prevent a top score, but overall, this is a strong submission.

##  Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Title and Objective** — **9/10**
- Title is clear and focused.
- Objective is concise and appropriate.
- Could more clearly state the intent to **compare measured friction factors with literature**.

### 2. **Background and Theory** — **9/10**
- Covers essential theory well, including Reynolds and Darcy-Weisbach.
- Mentions other equations (Chezy-Manning, Hazen-Williams) that were not used—somewhat distracting in this context.

### 3. **Apparatus and Materials** — **10/10**
- Detailed and comprehensive list.

### 4. **Procedure** — **9/10**
- Clear and logically organized.
- Could briefly mention that **mass flowmeter was ineffective at low flow** and **manometer was unreliable** as stated in expectations.

### 5. **Data and Analysis** — **8/10**
- Good tabular presentation of flow parameters and friction factor.
- Missing a clear **comparison of friction factor with expected literature values**.
- No mention of **Moody chart consistency** or **Re vs. f plot**, which is typically expected in this lab.
- Inclusion of hydraulic gradient plots is good.

### 6. **Discussion** — **9/10**
- Thoughtful analysis of trends and experimental reliability.
- Could better connect specific results to fluid dynamics expectations (e.g., expected f for Re < 2000).

### 7. **Conclusion** — **9/10**
- Concludes with emphasis on measurement comparison and learning outcomes.
- Could more directly state that **the manometer and flowmeter were unreliable under low flow conditions**, and time-to-fill and pressure transducers were more reliable.

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **9/10**
- Fluent, professional writing.
- Figures not clearly referenced or captioned in the body text.

### 9. **References and Attribution** — **7/10**
- Includes two relevant references.
- Effort sheet lacks detail on specific data processing tasks. No mention of how the group validated calculations or compiled plots.

## Suggested Results Summary Table (for future inclusion)

| Flow Regime | Re Number | Friction Factor (Measured) | Expected Range | Comment        |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Laminar     | ~400–1300 | 0.000012–0.000043          | 64/Re          | Acceptable     |
| Turbulent   | ~3000–9000| 0.000023–0.000071          | 0.03–0.04      | Lower than expected |

## Final Score: **89 / 100**

###  **Strengths**
- Strong engagement with experimental setup and theory
- Well-organized data tables and thoughtful conclusions
- Use of triplicate measurements and discussion of variability

###  **Areas to Improve**
- Explicitly compare friction factor values to theoretical ranges
- Reference figures clearly in the text
- More detailed division of labor and analytical tasks in the effort sheet
- Mention reliability issues with instrumentation more clearly in results and conclusions
