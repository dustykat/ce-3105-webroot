## General Feedback

The group demonstrates a good understanding of the relationships among flow rate, Reynolds number, and friction factor. The report includes complete calculations and identifies experimental challenges. However, clarity, formatting, and interpretive depth need improvement, especially in linking results to expectations and presenting data systematically.

## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Title and Objective** — **8/10**
- Clearly states the purpose.
- Sentence structure is awkward: “...changes in Reynolds numbers and friction” should be clarified.

### 2. **Apparatus and Materials** — **10/10**
- Comprehensive and appropriately listed.

### 3. **Experimental Procedure** — **9/10**
- Methods clearly described.
- Lacks explicit mention that flowmeter was ineffective at low flow and that pressure transducer was more reliable, as expected by the assignment.

### 4. **Background** — **8/10**
- Covers key principles like Darcy-Weisbach and major/minor losses.
- Missing any reference to literature values or expected friction factor trends (e.g., 64/Re in laminar flow).

### 5. **Data and Analysis** — **7/10**
- Shows thorough data tables and calculation steps.
- Presentation is inconsistent (e.g., “trail” vs. “trial”).
- Missing units on some variables.
- No plot of f vs. Re or comparison to standard models (Moody chart).
- Outlier friction factor values (e.g., 10.9) not adequately discussed.

### 6. **Discussion** — **8/10**
- Recognizes inverse f vs. Re trend and human error.
- Explanations are vague and informal in tone.
- Needs clearer comparison to theory or expected ranges.

### 7. **Conclusion** — **9/10**
- Reinforces relevance of friction factor to engineering.
- Some awkward phrasing (“play a very big role”), and interpretation could be tighter.
-  Correctly identifies the electric manometer as the most reliable.

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **7/10**
- Multiple grammatical issues and run-on sentences.
- Spelling errors (“trail” instead of “trial”), lack of figure/table referencing.

### 9. **References and Attribution** — **8/10**
- Effort appears balanced among team members.
- No citations of outside references or Moody chart data.

## Final Score: **84 / 100**

### **Strengths**
- Complete dataset and step-by-step analysis
- Good use of two measurement methods
- Clear evidence of effort and engagement with core concepts

### **Areas to Improve**
- Improve grammar, spelling, and formatting consistency
- Explicitly compare friction factors to theoretical ranges (especially 64/Re for laminar)
- Discuss outliers and measurement limits more clearly
- Add plot(s) showing f vs. Re or comparisons to Moody chart
