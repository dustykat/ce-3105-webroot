##  Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Title and Objective** — **9/10**
- Clear and descriptive.
- Could mention friction factor verification or instrumentation evaluation more explicitly.

### 2. **Background and Theory** — **9/10**
- Explains Bernoulli and Darcy-Weisbach equations appropriately.
- Missing explicit reference to **expected friction factor values** (e.g., from Moody chart) for comparison.

### 3. **Materials and Equipment** — **10/10**
- Thorough and complete listing of tools used.

### 4. **Experimental Setup & Procedure** — **9/10**
- Describes setup and measurement methods clearly.
- Could improve by elaborating on calibration steps and repeatability procedures.

### 5. **Results and Data Collection** — **9/10**
- Tables are appropriate and trends are discussed.
- Add unit labels to all values; a diagram of pressure tap positions would enhance clarity.

### 6. **Data Analysis** — **9/10**
- Discusses trends and connects data to theory.
- Does not show **actual friction factor calculations** or compare with **literature values**. No **explicit Reynolds numbers** shown.

### 7. **Conclusion and Discussion** — **10/10**
-  Addresses limitations of each measurement method.
-  Identifies pressure transducer as most reliable.
-  Concludes that time-to-fill was the only viable flow rate method due to low flow.
-  Includes thoughtful suggestions for future improvements.

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **9/10**
- Generally well-written.
- Minor typos (e.g., “Friction lass” in a figure caption).

### 9. **References and Attribution** — **10/10**
-  References course materials appropriately.
-  Effort sheet completed and signed.

##  Suggested Results Summary Table (for future inclusion)

| Flow Regime | Re Number | Friction Factor (Measured) | Expected Range | Comment        |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Laminar     | ~500      | 0.130                      | 64/Re          | Good match     |
| Turbulent   | ~4500     | 0.033                      | 0.03–0.04      | Reasonable     |

Even rough estimates like these would reinforce outcomes.

##  Final Score: **93 / 100**

###  **Strengths**
- Well-structured, with appropriate analysis
- Excellent teamwork and clearly divided responsibilities
- Proper identification of measurement limitations
- Effective interpretation of flow regime behavior

###  **Areas to Improve**
- Explicitly calculate and compare **friction factor** with theory
- Include actual **Reynolds number calculations**
- Add a compact **numerical results summary** (table or figure)
- Expand the discussion of **calibration** and measurement sensitivity in the method section
