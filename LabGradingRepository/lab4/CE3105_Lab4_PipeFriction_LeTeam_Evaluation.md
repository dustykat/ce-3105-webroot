## General Feedback

This report includes a well-written objective and a clear procedural breakdown, but it is missing core components. No data tables, analysis, calculations, or discussion of findings are provided. As it stands, this is an incomplete report. To receive full credit, the team should submit the full dataset, calculated results (Reynolds numbers, friction factors), and meaningful analysis comparing manual vs. automated methods.

## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective** — **10/10**
-Clearly outlines the purpose and scope of the experiment, including instrumentation goals and methodology.

### 2. **Materials and Procedure** — **10/10**
-  Comprehensive and appropriately structured.
- ✔Provides detailed steps for each measurement method.

### 3. **Results** — **1/10**
-  No tables, plots, or numerical data are presented.
- Only section headings and placeholders are included.

### 4. **Data Analysis** — **0/10**
-  Completely missing. No Reynolds number calculations, no friction factor estimation, no comparison to expected results or plots.

### 5. **Discussion** — **1/10**
-  Not present in this version of the report.
- This section should reflect on trends, compare flow rate and pressure readings across methods, and note instrument reliability.

### 6. **Conclusion** — **2/10**
-  Essentially empty—no synthesis of findings or reflection on theory vs. observation.

### 7. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **8/10**
-  Writing is clear in the sections that exist.
- Lack of content reduces the overall effectiveness of communication.

### 8. **References and Attribution** — **2/10**
- No references or team contribution section is included.
- Signatures and task roles missing.
