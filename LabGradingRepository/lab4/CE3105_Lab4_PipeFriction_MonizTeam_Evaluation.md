## General Feedback

This is an excellent report. The group demonstrated a solid grasp of experimental protocols, supported by thorough data analysis and clear articulation of concepts. Results are well-documented, and statistical analysis is appropriately integrated. Minor areas for improvement include clarifying assumptions in friction factor interpretation and minor stylistic cleanup.

## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective** — **10/10**
- Clearly stated objective with attention to both theoretical and procedural goals.
- Incorporates instrumentation learning and flow analysis.

### 2. **Equipment and Setup** — **10/10**
- Comprehensive list of equipment.
- Clearly explains data acquisition systems and measurement methods.

### 3. **Results and Calculations** — **9/10**
- Well-organized tables with Reynolds numbers, flow velocities, and friction factors.
- Includes statistical analysis of results.
- Some friction factor values (e.g., >1) are unusually high and could benefit from further contextual explanation or sensitivity discussion.

### 4. **Discussion** — **9/10**
- Strong narrative connecting theory to results.
- Identifies reliability trends in instruments and interprets variability.
- Could clarify expected ranges for f (e.g., compare with Moody chart) and potential sources of instrument inaccuracy.
