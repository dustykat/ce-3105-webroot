## General Feedback

This report demonstrates a sound conceptual grasp of fluid mechanics principles and a clear effort to apply theory to experimental results. While the theoretical background and qualitative discussion are strong, the data presentation lacks clarity, and key analytical components—especially calculations of Reynolds number and friction factor—are missing. With those elements included, this could be a top-tier report.

## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Theory** — **10/10**
- Covers all relevant principles, including Bernoulli, Reynolds number, hydraulic gradient, and Darcy-Weisbach.
- Clear equations and explanations throughout.

### 2. **Apparatus** — **9/10**
- Lists all required equipment and includes a labeled schematic.
- Would benefit from identifying units explicitly next to variables in the list for clarity.

### 3. **Results** — **7/10**
- Tables are provided with time and pressure data.
- Missing key information such as computed flow rates (in mL/s), calculated Reynolds numbers, and friction factors.
- Tables could use clearer labeling and formatting (e.g., columns are unclear in "Method 1").

### 4. **Discussion** — **8/10**
- Insightful commentary on system design, fluid flow impacts, and frictional behavior.
- Could better connect observed results to theoretical values and quantify the trends mentioned.

### 5. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
- Well-written synthesis of experimental outcomes and relevance to real systems.
- Covers laminar, turbulent, and transitional regimes correctly.

### 6. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **9/10**
- Clear language with minimal errors.
- Tables and figures would benefit from improved formatting and clearer integration into the narrative.

### 7. **References and Attribution** — **2/10**
-  No references cited.
- These are required for academic integrity and grading.
