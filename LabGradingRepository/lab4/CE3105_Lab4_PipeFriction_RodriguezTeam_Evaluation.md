## General Feedback

This is a well-structured and technically sound report. It clearly articulates theoretical principles, performs meaningful analysis, and provides thoughtful discussion on laminar and turbulent regimes. The use of figures would improve clarity, and more detailed comparisons to literature values (e.g., Moody chart) would strengthen the theoretical alignment.

## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective** — **10/10**
- Clearly states the purpose and ties goals to Reynolds number and friction factor analysis.

### 2. **Theory** — **9/10**
- Thorough and well-organized explanation of flow regimes and governing equations.
- Some digressions (Chezy-Manning, Hazen-Williams) are not used and distract from the focus on pipe friction.

### 3. **Materials and Procedure** — **10/10**
- Comprehensive and replicable. Includes safety and calibration notes.

### 4. **Data Collection & Analysis** — **9/10**
- Data tables are complete and include relevant parameters.
- No plots were included (e.g., friction factor vs. Reynolds number), which are expected in a full lab analysis.
- ✔ Assumptions (e.g., pipe diameter and length) are clearly stated.

### 5. **Discussion** — **9/10**
- Interprets trends correctly (e.g., Poiseuille’s Law, turbulent flow characteristics).
- Acknowledges possible transition regime for turbulent data.
- Could include more quantitative comparison to expected friction factor ranges (e.g., 64/Re in laminar, 0.02–0.03 in turbulent).

### 6. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
- Ties together laminar and turbulent observations effectively.
- Emphasizes consistency with theoretical predictions.

### 7. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **9/10**
- Generally clear and well-structured.
- Some repetition and long sentences could be streamlined.

### 8. **References and Attribution** — **6/10**
- Online references included.
- Most are informal (e.g., Wikipedia); stronger academic sources (textbooks, Moody chart) would be preferred.

## Suggested Results Summary Table (for future inclusion)

| Flow Type | Re Range | Friction Factor (Observed) | Expected Trend | Notes                        |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| Laminar   | 389–508  | 0.126–0.164                 | 64/Re          | Matches theoretical trend   |
| Transition| 1800–2300| 0.019–0.023                 | ~0.02–0.03     | Reasonable for smooth pipe  |

### **Strengths**
- Excellent theoretical foundation and data handling
- Clear tie between measured and expected trends
- Proper handling of assumptions and thoughtful interpretation

### **Areas to Improve**
- Include plots or graphs to support visual interpretation
