## General Feedback

This is a strong report with excellent theoretical grounding, clear protocol descriptions, and a thoughtful comparison of manual and automated methods. The group shows an understanding of frictional loss mechanisms and instrumentation behavior across laminar and transitional regimes. Minor enhancements to formatting, clarity in data presentation, and explicit comparison to theory would elevate this to an exemplary report.

## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective** — **10/10**
-  Comprehensive and clear, aligns well with the goals of CE 3105 Lab 4.

### 2. **Background/Theory** — **10/10**
-  Covers relevant theoretical models and fluid flow regimes.
-  Appropriate equations are included (Darcy-Weisbach, Reynolds, etc.).

### 3. **Apparatus and Procedure** — **9/10**
-  Thoroughly lists and describes all methods and devices used.
- Could more clearly tie each measurement tool to the conditions under which it was reliable or not (e.g., why the logger failed at low flows).

### 4. **Results** — **9/10**
-  Data is separated by test case, clearly indicating measurement technique.
- Some tables lack units or could benefit from clearer column formatting.
-  Includes computed Re and friction factors across flow conditions.

### 5. **Discussion** — **9/10**
-  Good interpretation of data and instrumentation behavior.
-  Recognizes measurement system sensitivity and calibration needs.
- Would benefit from explicitly referencing theoretical expectations (e.g., 64/Re, Moody chart behavior).

### 6. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
-  Strong, concise synthesis of findings and value of automation.

### 7. **References and Attribution** — **9/10**
-  Includes references from course and technical literature.
-  Clear effort attribution table.
- Effort section is correct but could include more detail on contributions.
