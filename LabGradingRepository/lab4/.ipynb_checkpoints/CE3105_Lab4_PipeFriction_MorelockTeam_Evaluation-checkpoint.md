## ✅ General Feedback

This is a technically strong and well-reasoned report that shows attention to detail in experimental design and post-analysis. The inclusion of parallel calculations using both manometer and handheld pressure instruments was executed well. The interpretation of trends and observed discrepancies in pressure drop are insightful. With more clearly labeled figures, direct plotting of friction factor vs. Reynolds number, and additional effort attribution, this would be near exemplary.

## 🧾 Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective** — **10/10**
- ✔ Clear articulation of multiple measurement objectives and instrumentation comparison.

### 2. **Materials and Methods** — **10/10**
- ✔ Excellent listing of equipment, steps, and safety considerations.
- ✔ Procedure shows good lab execution logic.

### 3. **Results and Analysis** — **9/10**
- ✔ Flow rate, pressure drop, Reynolds number, and friction factor calculations are present and accurate.
- ❗Some of the friction factor values (from the handheld device) are extremely high and not flagged as outliers until late in the text.
- ❗Would benefit from plots (f vs. Re) or side-by-side comparison tables between measurement methods.

### 4. **Discussion** — **10/10**
- ✔ Well-structured and thorough.
- ✔ Accurately identifies issues like air bubbles, calibration limits, and expected vs. observed discrepancies.
- ✔ Correctly interprets consistency of manometer-derived results and unreliability of handheld device at low flows.

### 5. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
- ✔ Synthesizes results into key takeaways about instrument sensitivity and method reliability.
- ✔ Suggests improvements with a practical engineering focus.

### 6. **References and Attribution** — **6/10**
- ✔ Lab manual cited.
- ❗Effort attribution (who did what) is missing or unclear.
- ❗Additional references (e.g., Moody chart or fluid mechanics textbook) could reinforce theoretical context.

### 7. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **9/10**
- ✔ Clear writing and well-explained equations.
- ❗Some tables are hard to read due to font/spacing; use clearer tabular formatting or labels.
- ❗Equation formatting in raw form may benefit from consistent LaTeX or inline formatting.
