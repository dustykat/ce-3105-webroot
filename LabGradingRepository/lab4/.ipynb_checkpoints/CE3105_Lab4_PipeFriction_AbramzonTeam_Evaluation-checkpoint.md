## ✅ General Feedback

This is a technically robust and well-written report with strong analytical depth and a clear connection to fluid mechanics principles. The team demonstrated excellent data handling and reflected critically on the discrepancies in pressure measurement. The only significant improvements needed are better graphical data presentation and more systematic comparison to theoretical friction factor values.
