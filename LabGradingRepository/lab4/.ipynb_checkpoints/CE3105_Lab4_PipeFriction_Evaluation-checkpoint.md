## 🧾 Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Title and Objective** — **9/10**
- ✔ Clear and descriptive.
- ❗Could mention friction factor verification or instrumentation evaluation more explicitly.

### 2. **Background and Theory** — **9/10**
- ✔ Explains Bernoulli and Darcy-Weisbach equations appropriately.
- ❗Missing explicit reference to **expected friction factor values** (e.g., from Moody chart) for comparison.

### 3. **Materials and Equipment** — **10/10**
- ✔ Thorough and complete listing of tools used.

### 4. **Experimental Setup & Procedure** — **9/10**
- ✔ Describes setup and measurement methods clearly.
- ❗Could improve by elaborating on calibration steps and repeatability procedures.

### 5. **Results and Data Collection** — **9/10**
- ✔ Tables are appropriate and trends are discussed.
- ❗Add unit labels to all values; a diagram of pressure tap positions would enhance clarity.

### 6. **Data Analysis** — **9/10**
- ✔ Discusses trends and connects data to theory.
- ❗Does not show **actual friction factor calculations** or compare with **literature values**. No **explicit Reynolds numbers** shown.

### 7. **Conclusion and Discussion** — **10/10**
- ✔ Addresses limitations of each measurement method.
- ✔ Identifies pressure transducer as most reliable.
- ✔ Concludes that time-to-fill was the only viable flow rate method due to low flow.
- ✔ Includes thoughtful suggestions for future improvements.

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **9/10**
- ✔ Generally well-written.
- ❗Minor typos (e.g., “Friction lass” in a figure caption).

### 9. **References and Attribution** — **10/10**
- ✔ References course materials appropriately.
- ✔ Effort sheet completed and signed.

## 📊 Suggested Results Summary Table (for future inclusion)

| Flow Regime | Re Number | Friction Factor (Measured) | Expected Range | Comment        |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Laminar     | ~500      | 0.130                      | 64/Re          | Good match     |
| Turbulent   | ~4500     | 0.033                      | 0.03–0.04      | Reasonable     |

Even rough estimates like these would reinforce learning outcomes.
