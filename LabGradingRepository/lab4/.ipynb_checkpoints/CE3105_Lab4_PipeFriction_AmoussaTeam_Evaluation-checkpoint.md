## ✅ General Feedback

This report represents a significant improvement over the earlier version submitted by the same team. It now includes essential tables, calculations, and a substantive discussion. The conclusions align with expected theoretical behavior, and the use of both manual and automated measurements is well contextualized. With some polish on formatting and citation, this would be a strong exemplar.

## 🧾 Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective** — **10/10**
- ✔ Clear and complete, with well-defined goals including automation comparison and flow regime analysis.

### 2. **Materials and Procedure** — **9/10**
- ✔ Comprehensive equipment list and clearly structured methodology.
- ❗Could specify which specific instruments were used for each data table more explicitly.

### 3. **Results** — **9/10**
- ✔ Tables include both flow and pressure data for low and high flow.
- ✔ Sample calculations are shown.
- ❗A plot of pressure vs. flow or friction factor vs. Re would greatly improve data presentation.

### 4. **Discussion** — **9/10**
- ✔ Thoughtful interpretation of results.
- ✔ Correctly identifies sources of error and their likely influence.
- ❗Could include a quantitative comparison to theoretical models (e.g., 64/Re or Moody chart).

### 5. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
- ✔ Well-written summary that synthesizes objectives, outcomes, and the role of instrumentation.

### 6. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **9/10**
- ✔ Generally professional tone and clean formatting.
- ❗Some sentences are wordy or could be restructured for clarity.

### 7. **References and Attribution** — **6/10**
- ❗No references or citations are listed in this version of the report.
- ❗Effort sheet still missing or not visible in this submission.
