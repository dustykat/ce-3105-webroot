## General Feedback

This is a well-developed report that thoroughly covers experimental procedure, data analysis, and interpretation. The group successfully applied core fluid mechanics concepts and thoughtfully addressed discrepancies in instrumentation. While the structure is clear and the results align with theory, clarity in formatting, equation notation, and improved citation would elevate the report further.

## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective** ‚Äî **10/10**
-  Clear and well-aligned with course goals.
-  Emphasizes experimental methods, data comparison, and flow classification.

### 2. **Theory** ‚Äî **9/10**
-  Covers relevant equations and concepts (Darcy-Weisbach, Poiseuille, Reynolds).
- Could benefit from formatting improvement‚Äîmath and subscripts occasionally inconsistent.

### 3. **Methods and Materials** ‚Äî **10/10**
-  Detailed and clearly structured.
-  Includes both manual and automated methods for pressure and flow.

### 4. **Results and Data Analysis** ‚Äî **9/10**
-  Data is well-organized and includes both raw and computed values.
-  Friction factor and Reynolds number trends are correct and meaningful.
- Some extremely high friction factor values (e.g., 3.566) are not flagged or explained thoroughly‚Äîhighlight as outliers.

### 5. **Discussion** ‚Äî **9/10**
-  Strong trend analysis and understanding of theoretical expectations.
-  Identifies instrument reliability issues (e.g., manometer vs. pressure meter).
- Consider referencing expected friction factor curves (e.g., 64/Re or Moody chart) more explicitly.

### 6. **Conclusion** ‚Äî **10/10**
-  Excellent summary tying together velocity, flow regime, and measurement technique.
-  Accurately identifies strengths and limitations in methods.

### 7. **References and Attribution** ‚Äî **8/10**
-  One solid course-based reference.
-  Effort sheet included and signed.
- Could include additional technical references (e.g., textbooks or Moody chart data).

### 8. **Clarity, Style, and Grammar** ‚Äî **5/10**
- Significant number of formatting issues in math notation.
- Several long paragraphs could benefit from sectioning or emphasis for readability.
- Imprecise or overly casual language in a few places (e.g., ‚Äúless the friction will impact the results‚Äù).
