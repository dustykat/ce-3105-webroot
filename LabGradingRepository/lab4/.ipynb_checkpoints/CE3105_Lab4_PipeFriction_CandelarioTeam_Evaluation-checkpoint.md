## 🧾 Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective** — **10/10**
- ✔ Clearly articulates the goal of analyzing flow, pressure, and head loss across multiple measurement methods.

### 2. **Theory and Background** — **10/10**
- ✔ Thoroughly explains Reynolds number, Darcy-Weisbach, friction factor, and flow classification.
- ✔ Excellent integration of theoretical concepts and relevance to engineering design.

### 3. **Materials and Methods** — **10/10**
- ✔ Clear, step-by-step procedures for manual and automated methods.
- ✔ Includes calibration steps and comparison strategies.

### 4. **Results and Analysis** — **9/10**
- ✔ Flow and pressure data are presented in detailed tables.

### 5. **Discussion** — **9/10**
- ✔ Discusses low vs. high flow effects, pressure behavior, and instrumentation discrepancies.
- ✔ Highlights measurement consistency and possible sources of error.
- ❗Should include more direct reference to theoretical expectations (e.g., 64/Re or Moody chart behavior).

### 6. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
- ✔ Strong summary of experimental success, flow regime classification, and instrumentation insights.
- ✔ Emphasizes the value of combining manual and automated methods.

### 7. **References and Attribution** — **8/10**
- ✔ Course references provided.
- ❗Effort attribution is not clearly detailed or signed.
- ❗Minor formatting repetition in references (duplicate entries).
