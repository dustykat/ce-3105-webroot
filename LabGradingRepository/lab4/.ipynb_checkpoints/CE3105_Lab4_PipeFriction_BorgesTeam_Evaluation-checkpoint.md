## ✅ General Feedback

This is a solid report with strong organization, well-articulated objectives, and thoughtful interpretations. The group appropriately used both manual and automated methods and demonstrated an understanding of how these affect accuracy and repeatability. Minor issues with formatting, data presentation, and more explicit comparison to theory prevent a perfect score.

## 🧾 Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Purpose** — **10/10**
- ✔ Clearly describes the aim and scope of the experiment, including comparison of instrumentation and evaluation of frictional losses.

### 2. **Experimental Setup and Method** — **9/10**
- ✔ Detailed and logically ordered.
- ❗Flowmeter limitations and manometer reliability issues should have been more explicitly acknowledged here.

### 3. **Results** — **8/10**
- ✔ Organized into tables with labels.
- ❗Missing figures or visualizations (e.g., friction factor vs. Re), which are typically expected.
- ❗Some tables appear referenced but not shown in the document text excerpt.

### 4. **Discussion** — **9/10**
- ✔ Good interpretation of instrumentation performance.
- ✔ Notes transitional regime and theoretical consistency.
- ❗Could further discuss how well results match standard friction factor models (e.g., 64/Re or Moody chart).

### 5. **Accuracy and Repeatability** — **9/10**
- ✔ Strong consideration of error mitigation and repeatability.
- ❗Could be clearer about the number of repeated trials and any statistical analysis used.

### 6. **Sources of Error** — **9/10**
- ✔ Thoughtful and well-reasoned.
- ✔ Mentions all key experimental challenges (timing, parallax, leaks, bubbles).
- ❗Some redundancy in explanation could be streamlined.

### 7. **Conclusion** — **10/10**
- ✔ Ties experimental goals to outcomes effectively.
- ✔ Emphasizes the importance of reliable measurement techniques in fluid systems.

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** — **9/10**
- ✔ Writing is professional and largely free of errors.
- ❗Long sentences could be broken up for improved readability.

### 9. **References and Attribution** — **7/10**
- ✔ Proper effort attribution.
- ❗Only one source is cited (course material). Inclusion of external sources (e.g., Moody chart, textbook) would strengthen this section.

| Flow Type | Re Range   | Friction Factor (Observed) | Expected Trend | Notes                   |
|-----------|------------|----------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Turbulent | > 4000     | Decreasing with Re         | ~0.03–0.04     | Matches trend qualitatively |
| Laminar   | < 2000     | Inverse to Re              | 64/Re          | Generally consistent     |
| Transition| ~2000–4000 | Mixed results              | Unpredictable  | Transitional flow effects |
