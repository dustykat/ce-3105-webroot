## General Feedback

This is a detailed and well-organized report with excellent technical coverage. The group clearly understands the theory, executes the experiment thoughtfully, and reflects effectively on data accuracy and instrument performance. Data is well-tabulated and demonstrates awareness of flow regime transitions and instrumentation limitations. With only minor improvements in data visualization and citation formatting, this report stands as an excellent submission.

## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. **Objective** â€” **10/10**
-  Clearly articulates the goal of analyzing flow, pressure, and head loss across multiple measurement methods.

### 2. **Theory and Background** â€” **10/10**
-  Thoroughly explains Reynolds number, Darcy-Weisbach, friction factor, and flow classification.
-  Excellent integration of theoretical concepts and relevance to engineering design.

### 3. **Materials and Methods** â€” **10/10**
-  Clear, step-by-step procedures for manual and automated methods.
-  Includes calibration steps and comparison strategies.

### 4. **Results and Analysis** â€” **9/10**
-  Flow and pressure data are presented in detailed tables.
-  Includes Reynolds number and friction factor for both flow regimes.
- Would benefit from **graphs** (e.g., friction factor vs. Reynolds number) to better illustrate trends.
- Some extremely high friction factor values in turbulent flow should be briefly addressed or flagged.

### 5. **Discussion** â€” **9/10**
-  Discusses low vs. high flow effects, pressure behavior, and instrumentation discrepancies.
-  Highlights measurement consistency and possible sources of error.
- Should include more direct reference to theoretical expectations (e.g., 64/Re or Moody chart behavior).

### 6. **Conclusion** â€” **10/10**
-  Strong summary of experimental success, flow regime classification, and instrumentation insights.
-  Emphasizes the value of combining manual and automated methods.

### 7. **References and Attribution** â€” **8/10**
-  Course references provided.
- Effort attribution is not clearly detailed or signed.
- Minor formatting repetition in references (duplicate entries).

### 8. **Clarity, Style, Grammar** â€” **10/10**
-  Report is well-written, logically organized, and free of major errors.
-  Clear formatting, with effective headings and explanation.
