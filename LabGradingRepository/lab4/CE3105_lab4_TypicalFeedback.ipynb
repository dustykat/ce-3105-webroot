    "## General Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an exemplary report—comprehensive, well-organized, and rich in technical content. The team demonstrates mastery in experimental design, theoretical grounding, and data analysis. The report effectively integrates both numerical data and contextual interpretation. Minor enhancements to plotting and clearer handling of anomalous friction factor values would elevate this to near-publishable quality for instructional use.\n",

    "##  Section-by-Section Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Objective and Introduction** — **10/10**\n",
    "-  Well-stated, contextually grounded objective.\n",
    "-  Clear description of experiment purpose and flow behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Theory and Background** — **10/10**\n",
    "-  Excellent coverage of Bernoulli, Darcy-Weisbach, Reynolds number, and alternate models.\n",
    "-  Sound explanation of friction factor determination and flow regime classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Apparatus and Procedure** — **10/10**\n",
    "-  Detailed and safety-aware methodology.\n",
    "-  Demonstrates control and understanding of manual vs. automated measurement limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Results and Analysis** — **9/10**\n",
    "-  Extensive data tables and calculated values for Re and f.\n",
    "-  Comparison between experimental friction factors and theoretical predictions.\n",
    "- Very high f values in the turbulent range not fully addressed—should be flagged or explored briefly.\n",
    "- Plots are adequate (e.g., Moody diagram), but could benefit from additional labeled axes or trendline overlays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Discussion** — **10/10**\n",
    "-  Excellent interpretation of data, flow regimes, and pressure loss behavior.\n",
    "-  Acknowledges limitations and measurement variability.\n",
    "-  Suggests appropriate error sources and recognizes transitional inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Conclusion** — **10/10**\n",
    "-  Strong, data-supported conclusion that revisits all learning objectives.\n",
    "-  Reflects thoughtfully on accuracy, trends, and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **References and Attribution** — **8/10**\n",
    "-  Includes multiple valid academic and technical references.\n",
    "-  Effort attribution completed and signed.\n",
    "- Minor formatting errors (e.g., citation spacing, online source redundancy).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Clarity, Style, and Grammar** — **10/10**\n",
    "-  High-quality academic writing throughout.\n",
    "-  Minimal to no grammatical or stylistic errors.\n",
