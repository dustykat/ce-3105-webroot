Feedback Report: Evaluation of Lab 6 Report (Group: Borges, Cantor, Lester, Saravanan)
Overall Comments
This report shows good structure and detailed discussion of the momentum transfer experiment. The group worked hard to describe error sources and practical applications thoughtfully. However, the experimental results were very inconsistent, likely due to apparatus issues, and key procedural clarifications and graphs were missing.

Strengths
Clear organization: Purpose, Theory, Procedure, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, and References are all properly included.

Good understanding of momentum principles: Conservation of momentum, static force balance, and fluid behavior were well explained.

Detailed error discussion: The mechanical issues affecting force measurement were thoughtfully analyzed.

Real-world applications were identified (turbine blade design, nozzle systems).

Areas for Improvement
1. Flow Measurement Method Clarity
No explicit statement about whether the mass flowmeter was used for measuring flow rates.

It appears manual time-to-fill or possibly bench flow readings were used.

Suggestion: Always explicitly state whether the mass flowmeter was used as the primary method (expected) and time-to-fill only as backup.

2. Experimental Data Consistency
Force coefficients were wildly overestimated (e.g., up to 6483% for flat plate and 5286% for hemispherical cup).

These huge errors likely stem from mechanical friction, improper balancing, or major misalignment.

Suggestion: Report experimental limitations more explicitly when results deviate so severely.

3. Missing Graphs and Coefficient Plots
No Force vs. Momentum Flux plots were provided.

No linear trendline slopes were reported to show experimental coefficients.

Suggestion: Include graphs to better validate trends and support coefficient calculations.

4. Force Ratio Interpretation
Force comparison between flat plate and hemispherical cup was not directly discussed in ratio terms.

It is expected that the flat plate force should be approximately 1/2 to 1/4 of the hemispherical cup force.

Suggestion: Include a ratio comparison to theoretical expectations.

5. Technical Writing
Several typographical errors were noted ("vocality" instead of "velocity", "fine" instead of "find", sentence fragments).

Some equations are missing, misformatted, or appear unfinished.

Suggestion: Proofread carefully and double-check equation formatting.

6. Quantitative Error Estimates
While a detailed qualitative error discussion is present, no rough numerical uncertainty (e.g., Â±5%) was given.

Suggestion: Include basic uncertainty estimates for better engineering rigor.
