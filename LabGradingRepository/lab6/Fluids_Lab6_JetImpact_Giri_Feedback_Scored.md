## Evaluation Summary

### Strengths:
- Theoretical section correctly states the core relationships of momentum transfer and provides equations for flat and hemispherical vanes.
- Discussion and conclusion are thoughtful and relate the lab to real-world fluid applications such as dam forces.
- Table of results includes volumetric flow rates and manometer readings across trials.
- Key variable definitions are listed clearly in the apparatus section.

### Areas for Improvement:
- The **mass flowmeter** is not mentioned as the primary method for flow measurement, nor is **time-to-fill** mentioned as a backup.
- There is **no summary or comparison** between flat plate and hemispherical vane forces (the 1/2 to 1/4 ratio expectation).
- **No analysis or plotting** of force vs momentum flux, or computation of force coefficients (expected: 1.0 and 2.0).
- Units are occasionally inconsistent or missing, and figures are not labeled or referenced in the text.
- The **conclusion remains general** and doesn't reflect specific numerical outcomes from the experiment.

## Recommendations:
- Clearly state instrumentation choices (e.g., “Mass flowmeter was used to record flow; time-to-fill was used only as a backup.”).
- Provide calculated values of theoretical and measured force and compare them explicitly.
- Plot force vs. momentum for both vane types, including best-fit trendlines and slope interpretation.
- Reference figures, use consistent SI units, and clearly present force comparisons between vanes.
- Expand the conclusion to include a discussion of results, such as error margins, force coefficients, or real data trends.

This report covers key theoretical ideas well but misses important quantitative elements.
