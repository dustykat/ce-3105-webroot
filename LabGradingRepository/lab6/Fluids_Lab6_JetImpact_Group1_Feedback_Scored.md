## Evaluation Summary

### Strengths:
- The objectives and theory sections are generally on-topic, describing flow and momentum ideas.
- Basic procedure steps match the **jet impact experiment** expectation (measure force vs flow).
- Writing is readable overall, and trends are noted qualitatively.

### Areas for Improvement:
- The **preferred flow measurement method** (mass flowmeter) was not explicitly stated; backup method (time-to-fill) not mentioned.
- There was **no discussion** of the expected force ratio (flat plate force ≈ 1/2 to 1/4 of hemispherical cup force).
- Data tables and figures were **not presented clearly** — no force vs momentum plots, no coefficient summaries.
- **Units** are inconsistently presented, and no detailed calculations are visible.
- **Mislabeling** the experiment in the title adds confusion.
- Some **grammar and structure issues** (e.g., misspelling "Labratory" in several places).
- **Sources of error** could be better developed, especially uncertainties in force measurement.

## Recommendations:
For future reports:
- **Clearly distinguish** mass flowmeter as primary measurement tool and time-to-fill as backup.
- **Quantify results** by calculating theoretical vs measured force coefficients for both vanes.
- **Plot Force vs. Momentum**, adding trendlines and slope analysis to verify theory.
- Label all tables and figures properly with **units** and **captions**.
- Carefully review the title page and headings to match the actual lab performed.
- Expand discussion on measurement uncertainty and real-world implications.

Overall, the report shows some conceptual understanding but lacks critical experimental analysis and formatting polish.
