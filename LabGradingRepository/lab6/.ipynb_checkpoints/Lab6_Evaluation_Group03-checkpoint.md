## Overall Comments

This laboratory report presents the results of an experiment on **momentum transfer by a jet** impacting two types of vanes: a flat plate and a hemispherical cup. The report is **well-organized** and **mostly complete**, with good effort shown in explaining the theoretical background, presenting procedures, and compiling the results. However, there are **several areas where improvements are necessary** for clarity, correctness, and completeness.

---

## Strengths

- **Good overall structure**: Objective, Materials, Procedure, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion are all present.
- **Clear Objectives**: The goals of the experiment are reasonably stated and tied to the principles of fluid mechanics.
- **Theory section** includes the correct governing relationships (momentum balance, force calculations).
- **Safety procedures** were thoughtfully included.
- **Data tables** for both vanes are provided, including measurements of flow rate, jockey weight distance, and calculated quantities.
- **Graphing of results** was attempted, including fitting a trendline to illustrate the experimental relationship between momentum flux and force.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Findings Related to Jet Impact and Flow Rate Measurements

- **Mass flowmeter** use was **not mentioned clearly**. According to the instructions, it should have been stated that the mass flowmeter was the primary tool for flow measurement and that the time-to-fill method was a backup.
- **Velocity loss analysis** was included, but the **discussion of mass flow measurement reliability** was superficial and did not specifically note the backup method.

> **Suggestion**: Explicitly state the methods used for flow rate determination and note any issues observed with the mass flowmeter or why backup timing was not emphasized.

### 2. Experimental Results Interpretation

- The **flat plate force** should be **approximately 1/2 to 1/4 of the hemispherical cup force**.
- In this report:
  - The flat plate experimental forces were around **6 N**.
  - The hemispherical cup experimental forces were around **11–12 N**.
  - **Ratio** ≈ 6/11 ≈ 0.55, which is a **bit high** but **acceptable** given experimental errors.
- However, **no explicit comparison** between flat plate and hemispherical cup forces was made in the discussion.

> **Suggestion**: Include a **direct statement comparing experimental flat plate and hemisphere forces**, noting whether the 1/2 to 1/4 relationship was achieved.

### 3. Technical Writing

- Numerous small errors reduce the overall technical polish:
  - "vain" should be corrected to **"vane"** throughout the report.
  - Grammatical mistakes ("vet velocity" should be **"jet velocity"**, "Flat Plate Van" should be **"Flat Plate Vane"**).
- Some descriptions are **repetitive**.

> **Suggestion**: Proofread more carefully. Technical reports should be precise and free of distracting language errors.

### 4. Figures and Visuals

- The **plots are included**, but **axes labels are minimal or missing**.
- No units were explicitly placed on axes (although implied).
- The **legend** is helpful but could be placed more clearly.

> **Suggestion**: Add **units** to all axis labels and use clean formatting for figures.

### 5. Error Analysis

- There is **some discussion of sources of error**, but it remains **vague**.
- Numerical estimates of uncertainty or percent error in measurements were not provided.

> **Suggestion**: Include **specific examples of error magnitudes**.
