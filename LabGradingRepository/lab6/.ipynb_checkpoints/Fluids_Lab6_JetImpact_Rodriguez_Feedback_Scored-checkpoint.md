## Final Score: **89/100**

## Evaluation Summary

### Strengths:
- Report includes all key components: Objective, Theory, Materials, Procedure, Data, Discussion, and References.
- Data tables are well structured and include force and momentum calculations for both vane types.
- Calculations show close agreement between theoretical and experimental forces (within ~8–9%).
- Discussion is thorough, interpreting velocity loss and force behavior with respect to vane geometry.
- Real-world application in turbine design is clearly identified.

### Areas for Improvement:
- **Mass flowmeter** is used, but not explicitly stated as the **primary** measurement tool.
- **Time-to-fill method** is not acknowledged as a secondary or backup method.
- The report does not include a clear **numerical summary of flat vs. hemisphere force ratio**.
- **No coefficient plots** are included (e.g., force vs. momentum flux with slope = coefficient).
- Some **interpretations of velocity loss** and coefficient values could benefit from greater precision and consistency.

## Recommendations:
- Clearly state instrumentation usage priority (e.g., “Flow measured via mass flowmeter; stopwatch used only as backup”).
- Add a summary or graph that compares flat and hemispherical vane force coefficients across trials.
- Plot **force vs. momentum flux**, include trendline, and interpret the slope as the coefficient of theoretical force.
- Reinforce conclusions with quantitative evidence and reference calculations.

This was a solid and well-structured report that would be enhanced by more explicit interpretation and clearer data visualization.
