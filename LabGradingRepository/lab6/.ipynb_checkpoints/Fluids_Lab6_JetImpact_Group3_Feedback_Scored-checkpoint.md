## Evaluation Summary

### Strengths:
- Very strong overall structure, including full Introduction, Theory, Materials, Setup, Procedure, Results, Analysis, Conclusion.
- All important theoretical relationships (Bernoulli, momentum conservation, mass flow rate) were correctly derived and applied.
- Mass flowmeter (automated logger) usage was strongly implied as primary, matching expectations.
- Flat plate and hemispherical cup experimental comparisons were thorough, including coefficient tables and graphs.
- Clear sample calculations provided in Appendix.
- Thoughtful real-world application discussion (hydraulic turbines).
- Error discussion covered key factors such as turbulence, imperfect deflection, and calibration drift.

### Areas for Improvement:
- There was no explicit statement that **time-to-fill was reserved only as backup**; only implied from procedure flow.
- The **flat plate vs hemisphere force ratio** (~1/2 expected) was discussed through coefficients but **not directly summarized**.
- A few **minor formatting issues**: figure captions could be more consistently placed; some tables were a little crowded.
- Slightly more **crisp summary** would have helped when comparing actual vs ideal force coefficients, especially for hemispherical target.

## Recommendations:
- Add a direct sentence stating **mass flowmeter was preferred** and **time-to-fill was backup** to avoid ambiguity.
- Include a **simple numerical comparison** highlighting that the flat plate force was about 1/2 the hemispherical force.
- Continue to improve figure labeling and spacing for readability.
- In future reports, conclude comparative discussions with a **quick key findings statement** summarizing percent differences or efficiency.

This was an **excellent and professional report** overall. Very well done!
