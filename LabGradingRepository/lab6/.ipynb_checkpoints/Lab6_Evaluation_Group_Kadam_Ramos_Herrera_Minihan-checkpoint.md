# Feedback Report: Evaluation of Lab 6 Report (Group: Kadam, Ramos, Herrera, Minihan)

## Overall Comments

This laboratory report is **well-structured** and provides a **good qualitative discussion** of momentum transfer in fluid jet impact scenarios. The group demonstrated a solid grasp of fundamental principles and produced a professional-looking report. However, **important omissions** regarding data processing, flow measurement method clarification, and graphical analysis prevented a higher evaluation.

---

## Strengths

- **Excellent report structure**: Objective, Background, Materials, Setup, Procedure, Results, Data Analysis, Conclusion, and Effort Sheet are cleanly separated.
- **Clear and understandable writing style**: Most technical explanations are accessible yet accurate.
- **Good practical error analysis**: Specific sources of measurement error (manual timing, friction, jet misalignment) were thoughtfully discussed.
- **Effort sheet completed properly**, documenting task divisions.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Flow Measurement Method Clarity

- Flow was measured using **manual timing with a stopwatch**, but the report does not clarify whether the **hydraulic bench's mass flowmeter** was used primarily, as expected.
- Only time-to-fill using a beaker and stopwatch is mentioned.

> **Suggestion**: Acknowledge that the hydraulic bench's mass flowmeter should be the primary tool, and manual methods used as a backup or for verification.

### 2. Experimental Interpretation and Force Ratio

- Hemispherical cup forces were **expected** to be roughly **2x the flat plate forces**.
- The results hint at this trend but **no explicit force calculation or ratio comparison** was provided.
- Only jockey weight displacements were compared, but force itself (not just displacement) is the important quantity.

> **Suggestion**: Explicitly calculate forces and compare flat plate to hemispherical cup force ratios to validate theoretical expectations.

### 3. Missing Data Calculations

- No clear presentation of derived quantities like:
  - Jet velocity
  - Momentum flux
  - Theoretical vs. measured forces
- No graphs (e.g., Force vs. Momentum Flux) were included.

> **Suggestion**: Add full calculations for mass flow rate, velocities, momentum delivery, and produce plots with trendlines and slopes.

### 4. Graphical Presentation

- No graphs were submitted, even though the assignment asks for plotting Force vs. Rate of Momentum Delivery.

> **Suggestion**: Include plots to visually support your conclusions and derive the experimental coefficients.

### 5. Technical Writing

- Minor spelling/grammar errors ("preformed" should be "performed"; "Data Aquisition" should be "Acquisition").
- "Picture of Equipment" on Figure 1 could be more descriptively titled.

> **Suggestion**: Proofread final reports carefully for typographical errors.
