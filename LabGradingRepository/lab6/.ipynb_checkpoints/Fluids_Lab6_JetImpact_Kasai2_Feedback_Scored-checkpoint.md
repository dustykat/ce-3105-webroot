## Evaluation Summary

### Strengths:
- The report includes all major sections: Objectives, Procedure, Results, Analysis, Discussion, Conclusion.
- Data tables are structured, and calculations for momentum flux and force are appropriately presented.
- Coefficients of theoretical force were calculated and compared to expected values (flat plate ≈ 1.0, hemisphere ≈ 2.12).
- Reasonable real-world applications and sources of error were considered.
- Correctly identified that angled vanes (e.g., 30°) would yield coefficients between flat and hemispherical types.

### Areas for Improvement:
- The **mass flowmeter** was clearly used but never explicitly stated as the **primary** method, and **time-to-fill** was not mentioned as a backup.
- The **flat vs. hemispherical force ratio** (~1/2 to 1/4) is visible in data but not summarized or highlighted.
- The document retains some **Jupyter notebook artifacts**, such as "In [ ]:" and raw formatting.
- The **conclusion is generic**, lacking specific engineering interpretations or future applications.
- Minor **clarity issues** exist in figure references and some units (e.g., ft² vs m² consistency).

---

## Recommendations:
- Explicitly state instrumentation priority (mass flowmeter vs backup) to clarify methodology.
- Add a short summary quantifying the difference in force between the flat and hemispherical vane.
- Polish formatting by cleaning out notebook code prompts and clarifying variable/unit annotations.
- Expand the conclusion to include **design implications or energy conversion relevance**.
- Maintain unit consistency and provide captions or labels for all plots and tables.

This is a technically sound report with only minor issues in clarity and polish. Strong job overall!
