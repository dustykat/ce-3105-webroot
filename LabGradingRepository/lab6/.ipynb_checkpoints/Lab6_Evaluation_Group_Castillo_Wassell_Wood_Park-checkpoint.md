# Feedback Report: Evaluation of Lab 6 Report (Group: Castillo, Wassell, Wood, Park)

## Overall Comments

This report shows **very good effort** with detailed data tables and an attempt to address theoretical versus measured force comparisons. However, some **key experimental documentation elements** (flow measurement method, clear trendlines and coefficients, proper ratio comparisons) were missing or handled inconsistently. Overall, it’s a **good report with moderate technical weaknesses**.

---

## Strengths

- **Complete data presentation**: Flow rate, mass flow rate, velocities, momentum flux, and forces are all tabulated.
- **Full Discussion section**: Addresses percentage velocity loss, coefficient comparisons, and error discussion.
- **Effort to include theoretical vs. actual force comparisons** is evident, even if formatting is inconsistent.
- **Practical applications discussed** (hydraulic machinery optimization).

---

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Flow Measurement Method Clarity

- Flow rates were determined via manual time-to-fill measurements.
- **No mention** of using the hydraulic bench’s **mass flowmeter** as the primary method.

> **Suggestion**: Always clearly state which measurement method was used, and specify that the flowmeter should be the primary unless unavailable.

### 2. Force Ratio Interpretation

- There is **some force comparison**, but no **explicit ratio statement** for flat plate versus hemispherical cup (i.e., 1/2 to 1/4 expected ratio).
- It is vital to show whether the flat plate forces were significantly less than the hemisphere forces.

> **Suggestion**: Include clear ratios (e.g., Flat Plate Force ≈ 50% of Hemisphere Force) to directly validate theory.

### 3. Technical Writing and Calculations

- Several typos ("vocality" instead of "velocity", "fine" instead of "find").
- Some tables are labeled confusingly (e.g., repeated "Ft lb-ft/s²" headings).
- Force calculations for angled vanes are inconsistent and not explained well.

> **Suggestion**: Proofread carefully and ensure all calculations are clearly labeled and logically justified.

### 4. Graphs and Trendlines

- No **Force vs. Momentum Flux plots** were included.
- No trendline slopes were reported as coefficients.

> **Suggestion**: Graphs are crucial. Force vs. Momentum graphs validate your experimental coefficients visually.

### 5. Error Analysis

- Some good error sources identified (timing errors, inconsistent beaker fill levels), but no attempt at **quantitative uncertainty**.

> **Suggestion**: Whenever possible, include an estimated uncertainty range (e.g., ±5%).
