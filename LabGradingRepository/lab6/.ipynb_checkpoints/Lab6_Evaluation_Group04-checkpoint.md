# Feedback Report: Evaluation of Lab 6 Report (Group 04)

## Overall Comments

This report addresses the **momentum transfer by a jet** impacting a flat plate and hemispherical cup. The students made a **good effort overall**, capturing key measurements and offering explanations based on fundamental principles of fluid mechanics. However, **technical polish and critical discussion** could be improved to better meet professional expectations.

## Strengths

- **Full structure present**: Objective, Theory, Procedure, Data, Analysis, Discussion, and Conclusion sections are included.
- **Clear Data Collection and Calculations**: Tables provide trial data for both vane types with reasonable formatting.
- **Good attempt at interpretation**: Discussion questions were answered clearly and consistently.
- **Application to real-world engineering** is correctly mentioned (hydroelectric power turbines).
- **Error analysis** identifies a plausible significant error source (calibration of the vane).

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Findings Related to Jet Impact and Flow Rate Measurements

- **Mass flowmeter use not specifically mentioned**; it was expected that the report note that the hydraulic bench's flow meter was used primarily, and that time-to-fill is reserved as a backup.
- **No cross-validation or mention of backup method reliability**.

> **Suggestion**: State clearly which flow measurement method was used and whether the backup method was considered.

### 2. Interpretation of Expected Force Ratios

- Flat plate forces were generally around **6.8–7.0 N**.
- Hemispherical cup forces were around **6.4–9.0 N**.
- The ratio (~6.9/8.8 ≈ 0.78) is **too high** compared to the expected 1/2 to 1/4 relationship.
- This is **not explicitly commented on** in the report.

> **Suggestion**: Include a direct comparison of experimental force ratios versus theoretical expectations. Discuss discrepancies and possible causes.

### 3. Technical Writing

- Typographical errors:
  - "vain" should be corrected to **"vane"** (multiple occurrences).
  - "vet velocity" typo needs correction.
- Units were occasionally missing from some columns or axes (small but important point).
- Some awkward phrasing in the discussion responses.

> **Suggestion**: Proofread carefully. Clear, correct language is crucial for professional engineering reports.

### 4. Graphs and Visual Presentation

- No graphs were included for force vs. momentum delivery.
- No trendlines or experimental coefficient determinations were shown graphically.
- Some data formatting in tables could be improved (e.g., better alignment of headers and numbers).

> **Suggestion**: Include graphs and best-fit lines for clarity. Explicitly state slopes of trendlines where appropriate.

### 5. Error Analysis Depth

- The discussion of error sources is good but lacks **quantitative estimates**.
- "Incorrect calibration" was cited as most significant but no comment on how much it could have shifted results.

> **Suggestion**: If possible, estimate how calibration error could affect force measurement outcomes.
