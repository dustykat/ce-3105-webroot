## Evaluation Summary

### Strengths:
- The report demonstrates a strong understanding of **momentum transfer** from jet impacts.
- The experimental procedure was clearly outlined and followed.
- **Equations and theoretical basis** for both flat and hemispherical vanes were appropriately cited.
- The results showed **force vs. momentum coefficients** close to theoretical:  
  - Flat Plate ≈ 1.0 (0.9951 measured)  
  - Hemisphere ≈ 2.0 (2.0509 measured)
- The data is presented in structured tables and supported with graphs showing trendlines.
- Excellent use of real-world application examples (e.g., HEC-RAS).

### Areas for Improvement:
- The report does **not explicitly affirm** that the **mass flowmeter was used primarily**, with time-to-fill as backup.
- While theoretical and measured coefficients were compared, there was **no summary or conclusion** noting that the **flat plate force was approximately half** of the hemispherical cup.
- Some figures or equations are not formatted cleanly in the text.
- The **error analysis** is brief—uncertainty in y-position is noted but not quantified or extended to impact force.
- Formatting has a few **minor consistency issues**, including spacing and paragraph alignment.

## Recommendations:
To strengthen future reports:
- Clearly state **preferred flow measurement methods**, especially if electronic instruments were used over manual.
- Add a **concise numerical comparison** of vane types: hemispherical ≈ 2× flat plate.
- Improve formatting of equations and units to enhance clarity.
- Expand error analysis, quantifying the impact of measurement errors where possible.

This is a very solid and well-reasoned report, demonstrating a clear grasp of the physical principles. With stronger emphasis on key conclusions and refined formatting, it would be excellent.
