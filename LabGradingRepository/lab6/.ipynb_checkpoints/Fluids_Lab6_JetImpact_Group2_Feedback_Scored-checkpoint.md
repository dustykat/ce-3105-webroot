## Evaluation Summary

### Strengths:
- All required components are included: Objective, Procedure, Results, Calculations, Discussion, and Conclusion.
- Theoretical relationships are correctly applied, including the use of Bernoulli and momentum equations.
- Velocity losses and force coefficients are reported for both vanes and align well with theory.
- Results tables are presented clearly and numerical analysis supports key conclusions.
- Graphs of force vs. momentum flux were included with correct slopes for flat plate (≈1.0) and hemispherical cup (≈2.0).
- Discussion and conclusion connect experimental findings to hydraulic machinery applications.

### Areas for Improvement:
- The **mass flowmeter** is used, but not explicitly called out as the **primary measurement method**.
- There is **no mention** that the **time-to-fill method** was reserved as a backup.
- The **flat vs. hemispherical force ratio** (~1/2 to 1/4) is evident in the data, but not clearly stated or summarized.
- Figures and graphs would benefit from **captions and improved layout formatting**.
- Some **discussion phrasing** could be tightened for clarity (e.g., more direct link from momentum flux to design relevance).

## Recommendations:
- Explicitly state the flow rate measurement approach and backup method.
- Add a one-line summary comparing the flat plate and hemispherical vane forces (e.g., "Flat plate force was about half of hemispherical").
- Improve formatting of figures/tables with numbered labels and descriptive captions.
- Use summary statements in the discussion to reinforce how data supports theoretical expectations.

This was a well-organized and technically accurate report overall. A few more direct statements and formatting polish would elevate it to top-tier.
