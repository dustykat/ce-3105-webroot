# Feedback Report: Evaluation of Lab 6 Report (Group: Cortez, Scott, Gonzalez, Melendez)

## Overall Comments

This report shows a **solid understanding of fluid momentum transfer** concepts and calculations, and the team made a **commendable effort in presenting their data**. However, several **critical issues** such as a mix-up in experiment objectives, missing explicit flow measurement method description, and incomplete graphical analysis prevented the report from achieving a higher score.

---

## Strengths

- **Well-organized structure**: Objective, Background, Materials, Procedure, Data, Analysis, Discussion, Conclusion, and Effort Sheet sections are all present.
- **Good sample calculations**: Step-by-step walkthroughs of flow rate, mass flow, force, and velocity.
- **Theoretical expectations** (greater forces for hemispherical cup vs flat plate) are broadly discussed and supported by data trends.
- **Error sources acknowledged** (e.g., measurement inaccuracies).

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Incorrect Objective

- The Objective mentions **pipe losses, diameter changes, and minor losses**, which are unrelated to this particular experiment (momentum transfer on vanes).
- This is likely a copy-paste error from a different lab.

> **Suggestion**: Always tailor the objective statement carefully to match the actual experiment performed.

### 2. Flow Measurement Method Clarity

- It appears that **manual measurement** (beaker + stopwatch) was used for flowrate determination.
- However, it is unclear whether the **hydraulic bench’s mass flowmeter** (preferred method) was used primarily.

> **Suggestion**: Clearly state that the mass flowmeter was the primary measurement tool if applicable.

### 3. Force Ratio Interpretation

- Flat plate and hemispherical cup forces are presented numerically but **no explicit ratio comparison** (flat plate ≈ 1/2 to 1/4 hemispherical cup) was made.
- It is **essential** to demonstrate whether this theoretical expectation was achieved.

> **Suggestion**: Calculate and explicitly discuss the force ratio between flat plate and hemisphere.

### 4. Figures and Graphs

- No Force vs. Momentum Flux graphs were included.
- No slopes or experimental coefficients were shown.

> **Suggestion**: Always include plots to validate data trends visually and derive empirical coefficients.

### 5. Technical Writing

- Minor grammar errors: e.g., "fine" should be **"find"**, "vocality" should be **"velocity"**.
- Equation formatting is inconsistent (some spacing and font sizing issues).

> **Suggestion**: Proofread final documents more carefully.

### 6. Minor Quantitative Detail Missing

- No formal uncertainty analysis (e.g., ± values for flowrate or force measurement).

> **Suggestion**: Include rough uncertainty estimates to strengthen the error analysis.
