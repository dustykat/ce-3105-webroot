# Feedback Report: Evaluation of Lab 6 Report (Group: Bene, Folletti, Manskie)

## Overall Comments

This laboratory report shows a **solid understanding of momentum transfer concepts**, with strong theoretical background and structured experimental methodology. The group made a **commendable effort in presenting and interpreting the data**, but there are **notable technical gaps** in data presentation, mass flow measurement methods discussion, and depth of interpretation.

---

## Strengths

- **Structured and clear layout**: Objective, Theory, Materials, Methods, Results, Analysis, Discussion, and Conclusion are all logically organized.
- **Good calculation walkthrough**: An example trial was carefully worked through before presenting summarized tables.
- **Effort to compute coefficients of theoretical force**: Flat plate (~0.587) and hemispherical cup (~1.77) coefficients were calculated and discussed.
- **Relevant real-world applications** mentioned (hydraulic machinery, turbines).
- **Acknowledges major error sources** (flow meter, splash-back, friction losses).

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Flow Measurement Method Clarity

- It is stated that the **hydraulic bench volumetric tank and stopwatch were used** for flow measurements.
- However, the primary method should have been the **mass flowmeter**, with time-to-fill as a backup. 
- No mention of using the flowmeter as primary tool.

> **Suggestion**: Clearly state that the mass flowmeter was the main tool unless it was unavailable or malfunctioning. Backup methods should be used only if necessary.

### 2. Force Ratio Interpretation

- Flat plate forces (~6.5–7.0 N) and hemispherical cup forces (~6.4–8.9 N) are **too close** together.
- The expected flat plate force should be **1/2 to 1/4** of hemispherical cup force.
- No explicit comment is made about this expectation.

> **Suggestion**: Compare your experimental force ratios explicitly to theoretical expectations. This is critical for demonstrating understanding.

### 3. Technical Writing

- Small grammatical and typographical errors present (e.g., "jets average" should be "jet's average"; "defects" instead of "deflects").
- Equation formatting is inconsistent, and copied equations sometimes have artifacts (like misaligned subscript/superscript formatting).

> **Suggestion**: Proofread and refine formatting, especially for equations and units.

### 4. Figures and Graphs

- No plots of force versus momentum flux are included.
- No trendline figures showing the slope (coefficient) visually.

> **Suggestion**: Include graphs! Visual comparison adds credibility to your interpretation of coefficients.

### 5. Error Analysis Depth

- The error discussion is thoughtful but remains qualitative.
- No attempt is made to estimate, for example, flow rate uncertainty or jockey position uncertainty.

> **Suggestion**: Provide **quantitative estimates** when discussing error sources whenever possible.
